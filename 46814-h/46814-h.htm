<h1 title="">GYPSY FLIGHT</h1>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">CHAPTER I</span>
<br />THE DARK LADY</h2>
<p>Rosemary Sample adjusted her jaunty
cap carefully, smoothed out her well-tailored
suit, then lowering her head, stepped
from her trans-continental airplane.</p>
<p>Oh yes, that was Rosemary&rsquo;s plane. Rosemary
was still young, and she looked even
younger than her years. A slender slip of a
girl was Rosemary, rather pretty, too, with a
touch of natural color and a dimple in each
cheek, white even teeth, smiling eyes of deepest
blue.</p>
<p>Strange sort of person to have a huge bi-motored
plane with two 555 horse-power
motors and a cruising speed of one hundred
and seventy miles per hour. It cost seventy
thousand dollars did that airplane. Yet this
slip of a girl was its captain, its conductor, its
everything but pilot, as long as it hung in air.
Rosemary was its stewardess&mdash;and that meant
a very great deal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>Rosemary stepped across the cement runway
with a buoyant tread. &ldquo;Life,&rdquo; she thought
with a happy tilt of her head, &ldquo;is just wonderful!
It is perfection itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosemary loved perfection. And where may
one find perfection of high degree if not in a
great metropolitan airport? Those giant silver
birds of the air, their motors drumming in
perfect unison, wheeling into position for
flight&mdash;how perfect! The touch of genius, the
brain and brawn of the world&rsquo;s greatest has
gone into their making. And as to the care of
them, Rosemary knew that the most valuable
horse in the world never received more perfect
treatment.</p>
<p>The depot, too, was perfect. Its hard white
floor was spotless. The ticket sellers, the loitering
aviators, even the black-faced redcaps
somehow appeared to fit into a perfect picture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The travelers and their luggage,&rdquo; she whispered,
&ldquo;they too fit in. No shabby ones. No
drab ones. Per&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>She did not finish for of a sudden, as if
caught and banged against a post, her picture
was wrecked, for a young man apparently unsuited
to the place had dashed through the
depot&rsquo;s outer door and, grasping her by the
arm, said in a low hoarse whisper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must speak to you personally, privately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a space of ten seconds there was grave
danger that Rosemary would deviate from the
path of duty, that she would smash Rule No.
1 for all airplane hostesses into bits. &ldquo;Courtesy
to all,&rdquo; that was the rule. And in the end the
rule won.</p>
<p>Getting a steady grip on herself, the girl
glanced about, noted that the small room to
the right was at that moment vacant, motioned
her strangely distraught visitor&mdash;who, if appearances
could be trusted, must have slept
the night before in an alley and fought six
policemen single-handed in the morning&mdash;inside,
after which she closed the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Than&mdash;oh thank you!&rdquo; the young man
gasped.</p>
<p>Then for a period of seconds he seemed
quite at a loss as to what he might say next.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>This gave the girl an opportunity for a swift
character analysis. She was accustomed to
this. She had flown for two years. Four hundred
thousand miles of flying were down to
her credit. Passengers, usually ten of them,
flew with her. It was her duty to keep them
comfortable and happy. To do this she must
know them, though she had seen them but for
an hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not as bad as I thought,&rdquo; was her
mental comment. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not been drinking.
He needs sleep. There&rsquo;s a lot of trouble somewhere.
But it&rsquo;s not <i>his</i> trouble&mdash;at least not
much of it. He needs help. He&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if reading this last thought, the youth
gripped her arm to exclaim:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must help me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo; Rosemary displayed all her
teeth in a dazzling smile. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my job.
How shall I help you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re flying west to Salt Lake City. Plane
leaves in half an hour. I must have a place in
that plane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; Rosemary truly was. She had
seen most of the other passengers. They promised
to be rather dull. But this young man&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sorry,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;The trip was sold
out forty-eight hours ago.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know&mdash;&rdquo; The young man&rsquo;s tone was impatient.
&ldquo;But&mdash;but it must be arranged.
Here!&rdquo; He crowded a small roll of bills into
her hand. &ldquo;You can fix it. I can&rsquo;t. You know
who they are. There must be no fuss. No one
must know. You find one. You know folks;
you can pick the right one. Surely there&rsquo;s one
of them that will wait until the night plane.
That&rsquo;s not sold out yet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be-believe me!&rdquo; His eyes were appealing
as he saw her waver. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not for myself. If it
were, I&rsquo;d never ask it. It&mdash;it&rsquo;s for a thousand
others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Rosemary was saying under her
breath, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not for himself. And so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; she said quietly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went away swiftly, so swiftly he could
not catch at her arm to thank her.</p>
<p>On entering the main waiting room of the
airport, the young stewardess looked quickly
about her. Twenty or more people were in the
room. Which were passengers, which mere
sightseers? She knew some of the men who
were to be with her on this trip. They were
old-timers, mostly traveling men. She would
not dare suggest to one of these that he sell
his reservation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>Her gaze at last became fixed upon a youth.
&ldquo;Must be about twenty,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
going. First trip. Nervous, and trying not to
show it. He&rsquo;ll welcome a delay, like as not.
Have to try.&rdquo; She took in his ready-to-wear
suit, his $5.99 variety of shoes, wondered
vaguely why he was going by air at all, then
plunged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean to tell me,&rdquo; he was saying slowly
three minutes later, &ldquo;that some man will give
me fifty dollars just to wait six hours for the
next plane? Say! I&rsquo;d wait a week. Where&rsquo;s
the money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here! Here it is.&rdquo; Rosemary felt a great
wave of relief sweep over her. She wanted to
ask this youth a dozen questions, but there
was not time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the name of the man that&rsquo;s taking
your reservation?&rdquo; the ticket seller asked of
the ready-to-wear youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have that for you right away, Charlie,&rdquo;
Rosemary broke in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O.K.&rdquo; Charlie turned to other matters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>Ten minutes later Rosemary received the
second shock of the day and from the same
source. Someone touched her on the arm. She
wheeled about to find herself looking at a
young man in spotless linen, faultless gray
suit and traveling cap. In his hand he carried
a dark brown walrus-hide bag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;why you&mdash;&rdquo; she stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick change artist.&rdquo; He smiled broadly.
&ldquo;Got hold of my bag, you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the young man who only a brief
time before did not fit into her picture of perfection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Di-did you get it?&rdquo; he asked. There was
a slight twitch about his mouth.</p>
<p>She nodded. &ldquo;Step over here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a marvel!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
tell you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she warned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to give your name and address
here,&rdquo; she said in a brusque tone. Then, &ldquo;Here
Charlie. This is the man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Name and address, please,&rdquo; said Charlie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Danby Force, Happy Vale, Connecticut,&rdquo;
said the young man promptly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Goodbye,&rdquo; said Rosemary, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be seeing
you.&rdquo; And indeed she should&mdash;many times.
The power behind all things, that directs the
stars in their courses, that keeps all the little
streams moving downhill and notes the sparrow&rsquo;s
fall, had willed that their paths should
cross many times and in many curious places.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is time,&rdquo; Rosemary told herself, &ldquo;for
a stroll in the open air before we take to the
air.&rdquo; Then, of a sudden, she recalled a curious
sort of plane that had landed but a short time
before. &ldquo;Wonder if it&rsquo;s still here.&rdquo; She hurried
out to the landing field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there it is! I must have a look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Speeding over the broad cement way, she
crossed to a spot where a small plane rested.
Truly it was a strange plane. It had been
painted to represent a gigantic dragon fly. Its
planes seemed thin and gauze-like. This, she
knew, was pure illusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how beautiful!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is beautiful.&rdquo; To her surprise, she
was answered by a blonde-haired girl who had
just stepped round the plane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is&mdash;is it yours?&rdquo; she asked in surprise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But yes.&rdquo; The strange girl spoke with a
decided French accent. &ldquo;I am the one they
call Petite Jeanne. You have heard of me. No?
Ah well, it does not matter.&rdquo; She laughed a
silvery laugh. She was, Rosemary noted, a
slender girl with beautifully regular features
and dancing eyes. &ldquo;Dancing feet too,&rdquo; she
whispered to herself. &ldquo;They are never still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unconsciously she had been following the
girl round the plane. There, on the other side,
she met with a surprise. Seated on bright colored
bundles, close to a small fire over which
a small teakettle steamed, was a large, stolid-looking
gypsy woman and a small gypsy girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the gypsies are taking to the air!&rdquo; she
exclaimed. &ldquo;And you&mdash;&rdquo; she turned to the
blonde girl, &ldquo;are you a gypsy too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you like.&rdquo; A cloud appeared to pass
over the girl&rsquo;s face. It was followed by a smile.
&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am flying now. And
you, since you are flying always, you may see
me again in some strange new place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; she added after a brief silence,
&ldquo;Madame Bihari here, who is my foster
mother, was telling my fortune with cards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your fortune?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But yes.&rdquo; The girl laughed merrily. &ldquo;What
would a gypsy be if she did not tell fortunes?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And in my fortune,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;I was to
meet a stewardess of the air. This meeting
was to lead me into strange and mysterious adventures.
And now here you are. Is it not
strange? It is very wonderful, truly it is, this
telling fortunes with gypsy cards. You must
try it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; replied Rosemary. &ldquo;But now it is
almost time for my plane. I&rsquo;ll hope to be seeing
you. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One moment please!&rdquo; Bending over, the
blonde girl picked up three small sticks.
&ldquo;Wherever I land,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;I shall put
two sticks so, and one stick so, close to the
door of the airport depot. If you see it you
will know that I have been there and may be
there still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I get you,&rdquo; Rosemary laughed, &ldquo;but what
do you call that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is our gypsy <i>patteran</i>,&rdquo; the girl explained
soberly. &ldquo;It is a custom older than any of
your country&rsquo;s laws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! I&rsquo;ll be seeing you!&rdquo; Rosemary hurried
away. She was not soon to forget this
blonde-haired Petite Jeanne, whom so many
of you already know well. Nor was she to
forget that even the gypsies had taken to the
air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>After casting a practiced eye over the interior
of her ship, adjusting a chair and looking
to her supply of newspapers and magazines,
Rosemary stepped down from the plane into
the sunlight of a glorious day.</p>
<p>A porter was wheeling the baggage cart into
position, the chain was being dropped. In an
even tone through a microphone the announcer
was saying, &ldquo;Plane No. 56 leaving
for Omaha, Cheyenne, Salt Lake City and
points west, now loading.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be in the air soon,&rdquo; Rosemary whispered
to herself. The faintest possible thrill
ran up her spine. For this very-much-alive
girl, even after two years of flying, could
never quite still the joy and thrill of flight.</p>
<p>Then the sound of an excited voice reached
her ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must take the bag with me in the cabin,&rdquo;
a woman&rsquo;s voice was saying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that is contrary to the rules,&rdquo; the attendant
at the gate replied politely. &ldquo;The cabin
is small. A brief case is quite all right. But
bags, no. If everyone took a bag inside, there&rsquo;d
be no getting about. We will give you a check
for your bag. It will be locked in the baggage
compartment. Nothing can happen to it. In
case of loss, the Company&rsquo;s millions insure
you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But I want&mdash;&rdquo; The tall, dark-complexioned
owner of the bag cast a sweeping glance
over her fellow travelers who stood awaiting
their turn at the gate. She appeared to suspect
them, one and all, of having designs on
her bag.</p>
<p>The much-traveled commercial passengers
smiled indulgently, two ladies gave the dark-complexioned
one a half sympathetic glance.
But the young man who had, through Rosemary&rsquo;s
good offices, so recently acquired a
place on the plane favored her with not so
much as a look. He appeared to have become
greatly interested in a small yellow plane that
was just then taking off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He just <i>seems</i> to be interested in that
plane.&rdquo; The thought leapt unbidden into the
young stewardess&rsquo; mind. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s more interested
in that woman than he&rsquo;d like anyone to
know. I wonder why?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh well, if you insist!&rdquo; The dark-complexioned
lady dropped her bag, grabbed impatiently
at the check offered for it, then hurrying
past Rosemary without affording her so
much as a look, climbed aboard the plane to
sink into the seat farthest to the rear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if she proposed to watch the others all
the way to Salt Lake City,&rdquo; was Rosemary&rsquo;s
mental comment, although she knew the
thought to be unwarranted and absurd.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, with all on board, they
were sailing out over the city. Rosemary settled
down to the business of the hour. She
loved her work, did this slender girl. Hers
was an unusual task. She performed it unusually
well. She was in charge of the &ldquo;ship&rdquo;
while it was in the air. She was hostess to
the ten passengers entrusted to her care. At
once her alert mind took up the problems of
this particular journey. She smiled as two of
the four traveling men launched forth on a discussion
of the country&rsquo;s economic problems.
&ldquo;That settles them,&rdquo; she told herself. The third
traveling man buried himself in the latest
newspaper, and the fourth dragged out papers
from his brief case to pour over figures. Two
rather flashily dressed young men, who had
not slept the night before, asked for pillows.
They were soon checked off to the land of
dreams. Two middle-aged women began discussing
the feeding and training of children.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>All this left to Rosemary&rsquo;s care only the
dark-complexioned woman in a rear seat and
the young man of great haste. &ldquo;A very quiet
trip,&rdquo; she told herself. In this, as all too often,
she was mistaken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can I do for you?&rdquo; She flashed a
smile at the dark-complexioned woman. She
received no smile in reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Magazine? A pillow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Nothing.&rdquo; The woman&rsquo;s black and
piercing eyes were fixed upon her for a full ten
seconds. Then they shifted to the world beneath
the swiftly gliding plane.</p>
<p>Rosemary was neither dismayed nor disheartened.
There were many such people. All
they wanted was to be left alone with their
thoughts. Perhaps flashing through the air
thousands of feet from the ground brought
serious and solemn thoughts to some types of
mind. She rather guessed it did.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>But how about the young man of great
haste? He intrigued her. Perhaps he was the
kind who liked to talk. If he were, then perhaps
he would tell secrets. Men often told her
secrets. She always guarded them well. &ldquo;He
may tell me why he was in such great haste,&rdquo;
she thought to herself.</p>
<p>Some people like to talk, some to listen. It
is the duty of an airplane stewardess to talk
or to listen as occasion demands. Rosemary
was prepared in this case, as in all others, to
do her duty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange sort of profession, yours,&rdquo; the
young man said, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s wonderful work!&rdquo; Rosemary knew on
the instant that she would do most of the talking.</p>
<p>For half an hour he asked questions and she
answered them. His questions, never very
personal, were about the life an airplane stewardess
leads. She answered them honestly and
frankly. &ldquo;He honestly wants to know,&rdquo; she
told herself. &ldquo;He is the type of person who
absorbs knowledge as a sponge does water.
Delightful sort. I&rsquo;d like to know him better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look!&rdquo; he exclaimed suddenly. &ldquo;The
propeller on this side is gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; She laughed low. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not gone.
Just going around so fast you can&rsquo;t see it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But I saw it revolving when we started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were going slowly then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is really still there, producing tremendous
power, helping pull us along&mdash;tons of
people, mail and steel&mdash;at a hundred and seventy
miles an hour! And yet we cannot see
it. Marvelous! Unseen power!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s like God&rsquo;s
influence on our lives. You can&rsquo;t see it, you
can&rsquo;t feel it as we feel things with our hands;
yet it is there, a tremendous force in our lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she agreed soberly, &ldquo;it must be like
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment she found herself liking this
strange young man very much. It was, she
believed, because of his deeply serious
thoughts.</p>
<p>Having discovered that the two traveling
salesmen had settled all the nation&rsquo;s problems
and were looking for reading material, she excused
herself, gripped the seat ahead to steady
her, then moved swiftly forward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>With all her passengers happy once more,
she dropped into the one vacant seat to indulge
in a few moments of quiet meditation. Into
this meditation there crept, as she closed her
eyes, a slim girlish figure. Blonde-haired and
smiling, she stood beside a plane that resembled
a dragon fly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The flying gypsy,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;But is
she a gypsy?&rdquo; To this question she found no
answer.</p>
<p>That this slender girl was an interesting person
she did not doubt. She found herself hoping
that the gypsy woman&rsquo;s fortune telling
might prove a success&mdash;that they might meet
many times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mystery and adventure, those were the
words she used.&rdquo; Mystery and adventure.
Well, this day had not been without its mystery.
There was the strange man, Danby
Force, and his urgent need for going somewhere.
Then too there was the dark woman
with the bag which she had all but refused to
trust away from her, even in the locked compartment
of a trans-continental plane. What
could she have in that bag? The girl thought
of one instance when it had been believed that
high explosives carried in a bag on an air-liner
had brought disaster to a score of persons.
&ldquo;But of course it would not be that,&rdquo; she told
herself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>Rising from her place, she moved back to
where the dark-faced one rode. She seemed
fast asleep. But was this only a pose? She
could not tell. Someone forward beckoned to
her. Routine duties were resumed.</p>
<p>The hours passed quietly. At five o&rsquo;clock
they were over the Rockies. Marvelous moment!
The golden sun was sinking over the
distant prairies. The mountains, half white
with snow, half green with forests, lay beneath
them. They were beyond the timber line.</p>
<p>Suddenly the co-pilot&rsquo;s light blinked at the
back of the cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Signaling for me. I wonder why.&rdquo; She
moved swiftly forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A storm roaring up the mountains from the
west.&rdquo; Mark Morris, the young co-pilot, spoke
in short jerky sentences. &ldquo;Going down here.
Landing field of a sort. Laid out on the plateau.
Hunting lodge below. No real danger.
Get straps hooked up. Usual stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosemary understood. She passed swiftly
along the aisle. A word, a whisper, a smile,
that quiet, care-free air of hers did the work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forced landing. What of that?&rdquo; This was
what the passengers read in her face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>What indeed? They swooped downward,
bumped with something of a shock, bumped
more lightly, glided forward, then came to a
standstill.</p>
<p>The tall dark woman sprang to her feet,
threw open the door, then swung herself down.
She was wearing low shoes and sheer silk
stockings. She landed squarely in eighteen
inches of snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Rosemary cried in dismay. &ldquo;Give
her a hand up, some of you men. I&rsquo;ll fix you
all up right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were, of course, neither high boots
nor leggings in the airplane cabin, but Rosemary
was equal to the occasion. Tearing up a
blanket, she was soon busy fashioning moccasins
for the ladies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tie these cords about the bottoms of your
trousers,&rdquo; she said to the men. &ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;ll go
down to the hunting lodge. Be three or four
hours anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the trail?&rdquo; She spoke now to the
young co-pilot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See that big rock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Blazed trail starts there. Easy to follow.
About half a mile. Fine place. Been there three
times. Big fireplace. Bacon and other things
to eat. You&rsquo;ll enjoy your stay,&rdquo; he chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All airways are beaten trails to our pilots,&rdquo;
Rosemary murmured.</p>
<p>A cold wind came sweeping up the mountain.
Sharp bits of snow cut at their cheeks.
They were impatient to make a start when, as
before, the dark-faced lady held them up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My bag!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I must have it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Safe enough here,&rdquo; said Mark. &ldquo;All locked
up. We&rsquo;re staying, the pilot and I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I insist!&rdquo; She stamped the ground impatiently.</p>
<p>Five minutes of chilling delay, and she had
it. Nor would she relinquish its care to the
most courteous traveling man. She plunged
through the snow with it banging at her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer about that bag,&rdquo; Rosemary murmured
to Danby Force, who marched at her
side.</p>
<p>To her surprise he shot her a strange&mdash;perhaps,
she thought, a startled look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if I had discovered some secret,&rdquo; she
thought to herself. &ldquo;Well, I haven&rsquo;t&mdash;not yet.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>After floundering through the snow for
some distance, they came at last to a spot
where a trail wound down the mountainside.
Ten minutes of following this trail brought
them to a long, low, broad-roofed building
that, in the gathering darkness, seemed
gloomy and forbidding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine place for a murder,&rdquo; Danby Force
whispered to Rosemary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that!&rdquo; She shuddered.</p>
<p>Stamping their feet on the broad veranda,
they pushed the door open and entered. Danby
Force struck a match. Directly before him, at
the opposite side of the room, was a fire all
laid in a broad fireplace. The young man&rsquo;s
second match set a mellow glow of light from
the dancing flames searching out every dark
corner. For the time at least, the place lost its
forbidding aspect. Indeed it might well have
been the banquet hall of some ancient British
hunting lodge, of long ago.</p>
<p>Nor was the banquet lacking. Rosemary
Sample was from Kansas. And in Kansas
mothers teach their daughters to cook. Fragrant
coffee, crisp bacon, candied sweet potatoes,
plum pudding from a can, steamed to a
delicious fineness&mdash;this was the repast she prepared
for the guests of her trans-continental
airplane.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>All thoughts of the dark-faced lady&rsquo;s mysterious
bag, of Danby Force&rsquo;s urgent need, and
of the gypsies&rsquo; fortune telling were forgotten
in the merriment that followed. One of the
college youths, who had slept all the day, discovered
an ancient accordion and at once began
playing delirious music. The rough floor
was cleared and all joined in a wild dance&mdash;all
but the dark-faced one who sat gloomily in a
corner.</p>
<p>From time to time as the music died away,
Rosemary listened for the sounds that came
down the chimney. There was a whistle and
a moan, the sighing of evergreen trees and
then a rushing roar as if a giant were blowing
across a mammoth bottle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be here all night,&rdquo; she said to Danby Force
at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess so. Fine place for a murder.&rdquo; He
smiled at her in a curious way as he repeated
that weird remark of a few hours before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Strange place for a&mdash;&rdquo; Rosemary could not
make her lips form that remaining word as,
two hours later, staring into the dark, she
whispered that line. She was in the bunk room
at the back of the lodge. The women of the
company were all sleeping there. The men had
cots before the fire in the main room.</p>
<p>The dark lady had dragged her traveling
bag into the farthest corner and had crept beneath
her blankets after very little undressing.
A very strange person, this dark lady. Rosemary
did not exactly like her, but found in her
a certain fascination. Even now, as she turned
her face toward that corner, she fancied that
she could see her eyes shining like a cat&rsquo;s eyes
in the dark. Pure fancy, she knew, but disturbing
for all that.</p>
<p>Just when she fell asleep she never quite
knew. She was always definite about the time
of waking&mdash;it was just at the break of dawn.
She was startled out of deep sleep by a sudden
piercing scream. Instantly Danby Force&rsquo;s
words came to her. &ldquo;Fine place for a murder.&rdquo;
But there had been no murder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER II</span>
<br />THE VANISHING BAG</h2>
<p>&ldquo;My bag! It is gone! My traveling bag!
It has been stolen!&rdquo; The young stewardess
knew on the instant that the dark-faced
lady was the one who was screaming. That
the bag was truly missing she did not doubt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s happened,&rdquo; she thought to herself
as she tumbled from her bunk.</p>
<p>What she said to the dark-faced lady was
done in a more official manner:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it can&rsquo;t be far away. Someone has
moved it by mistake. We&rsquo;ll dress, then we will
have a look.&rdquo; Her tone was calm enough,
though her heart was not.</p>
<p>They did dress and they did have a look&mdash;several
looks, but all to no avail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>To Rosemary this was distressing. The
whole affair had gone off so extremely well
until now. Of course no one had wished to be
delayed on the journey, but the evening in the
lodge had been a delightful one. She had
planned waffles with real maple syrup and coffee
for breakfast. And now came this. It was
disheartening.</p>
<p>Here in the gloom of early morning was the
dark-faced woman claiming that her traveling
bag had been taken. And who, in the end,
could doubt it? It surely was not to be seen
in the bunk room. Everything was turned over
there except the dark one&rsquo;s bunk which had
been made up. And of course in a bunk flat as
a pancake one does not look for a sizable traveling
bag stuffed with all manner of things.</p>
<p>It was not in the large outer room either.
When they went outside to see if some person
might have crept in and taken it, or, as the
dark-faced one insisted, &ldquo;crept out to hide it&rdquo;
there was the clean white snow with never a
track save the half-buried one of Mark Morris
coming to report on the progress of the storm
some hours before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the strangest thing!&rdquo; said Rosemary,
for once finding herself quite out of bounds.
&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t have gotten away. It just can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I insist that every person in the place be
searched!&rdquo; the dark woman demanded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What! Search our pockets for a traveling
bag?&rdquo; A rotund drummer roared with laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for the bag, but for the valuable papers
I carried. The bag, more than likely, has
been burned in the fireplace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absurd!&rdquo; exclaimed one of the middle-aged
ladies. &ldquo;Leather creates a terrible odor when
burned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who said it was leather?&rdquo; snapped the inquisitor.
&ldquo;It was, I believe, fiber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the end, for the good of her company&rsquo;s
reputation, Rosemary persuaded them to submit
to a search of a sort. The men emptied
their pockets, then turned them inside out. The
dark-faced woman went over the other women
with hands that suggested they might have
been used for that same purpose often, so deft,
precise and cat-like were her motions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>It was while the men were going through
their part of the performance that the young
stewardess noticed a curious thing. The woman
watched them all with what appeared to be
slight interest until it came the turn of Danby
Force who had paid so high a price for his reservation
on this plane. Then it seemed to the
girl that veritable sparks of fire shot from the
black eyes of the woman. That she took in
every detail was evident. That a look of grim
satisfaction, seeming to say, &ldquo;Ah ha! It is as I
thought!&rdquo; settled on the woman&rsquo;s face at that
moment, the girl could not for a moment
doubt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; she asked herself. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this question she could form no sensible
answer for, as in all other cases, the woman
said in a low tone: &ldquo;None of these are mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then the airplane pilot came in to tell
them that the storm was at an end and they
might resume their journey. In the rush of
preparation, the hurried brewing of coffee, the
hasty eating of a rather meager breakfast, the
dark-faced woman and her vanished traveling
bag were pretty much forgotten.</p>
<p>When at last the travelers were on their
way, walking single-file up the steep incline,
Rosemary found herself standing quite unexpectedly
beside the strange young man, Danby
Force.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful place, this lodge!&rdquo; he was saying.
&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t mind coming up here for a
week sometime.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I!&rdquo; Rosemary spoke with unfeigned
enthusiasm. And who would not? They were
standing on a broad ledge. Above them, seeming
to melt into the fleecy clouds, was the
mountain&rsquo;s snowy peak. Below, a sheer drop
of a thousand feet, was a very narrow valley
all covered with the dark green of pine, spruce,
cedar and tamarack. The air was rich with
the fragrance of the forest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the high officials in our company is
a member,&rdquo; Rosemary said, nodding back at
the lodge. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we are free to use it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fancy I shall be coming back.&rdquo; The young
man spoke slowly. He looked her squarely in
the eyes. Then turning, he followed swiftly
after the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he mean by that?&rdquo; Rosemary
asked herself. A strange thought leaped unbidden
into her mind. &ldquo;Supposing the young
man took the missing bag and hid it somewhere
about the place?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Where could
he have hidden it? No one had been outside,
absolutely no one. And if he did take it, surely
he would not tell me he hoped to return.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>Then a strange fact struck her&mdash;the look on
this young man&rsquo;s face had changed. When she
first saw him he had the appearance of one
who had gone through much, who was still
haunted by the thought of some great loss.
Now his face was as bland and cheerful as an
early spring morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What am I to make of that?&rdquo; she asked
herself.</p>
<p>The answer in the end appeared simple
enough, &ldquo;One good night&rsquo;s sleep.&rdquo; This, she
knew full well, was capable of working wonders
on a young and buoyant spirit.</p>
<p>It is strange the manner in which a single
incident may change the whole course of
thought for an entire group. As they resumed
their journey to Salt Lake City, no one in the
plane discussed economic conditions or child
welfare. No one read. No one wrote or figured.
When they spoke it was in low tones just
above the roar of the motors. And Rosemary,
though she heard never a word, knew they
talked of the dark-faced woman and her missing
bag. &ldquo;And those who do not talk are thinking
of it,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;And it <i>is</i> strange!
What can have become of that bag?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if reading her thoughts, Danby Force
leaned across the aisle to say in a low distinct
tone: &ldquo;I fancy Santa Claus must have come
down that broad chimney and carried it off.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>Those were the only words spoken to her
until they were nearing their destination. Then
that strange young man leaned over once more
to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curious sort of job you&rsquo;ve got here! Necessary
enough, though. And you fit in very
well, I can see that. I am no end grateful for
what you did back there in Chicago. You
saved the situation for me, you surely did!
Hope I may travel with you often. This is my
first trip by air, but not the last&mdash;you may be
assured of that. I enjoy being carried along by
this&mdash;this invisible power.&rdquo; He chuckled.
&ldquo;And I&mdash;I like the company, if you don&rsquo;t mind
my saying it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the least. I&rsquo;ve enjoyed knowing
you.&rdquo; Rosemary was vexed at herself for saying
so trite a thing. Truth was, her mind was
still filled with that missing bag. That the
dark-faced woman would report the loss to the
office and that there would be no end of fuss
about it, she did not doubt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;d like to know you better,&rdquo; she added
as a kind of after-thought, as she favored Danby
Force with a smile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You will,&rdquo; he prophesied, &ldquo;Oh yes, I am
sure you will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she told herself a moment
later, &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t know much except that he says
his name is Danby Force and that he fancies,
at least, that he can be of service to a few thousand
people. Well&mdash;&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s really
something, if it&rsquo;s not pure fancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The landing field at Salt Lake City seemed
hot after their rapid gliding down from the
lands of perpetual snow. In spite of this, Rosemary
Sample breathed a sigh of relief. Her
journey was over. From this point the party
would break up. She would rest for a few
hours, then go soaring back to home base
where she was to have two whole days to herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess we&rsquo;d better stick around for a bit,&rdquo;
suggested the pilot. &ldquo;That woman will be putting
in a complaint. We&rsquo;ll have to tell what
we know.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>&ldquo;For that matter, though,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t see that we have much responsibility in
the matter. She refused to leave the bag locked
in the plane where it would have been safe.
Took the matter in her own hands. The bag
was in her possession when it disappeared.
So&mdash;o!&rdquo; He smiled. &ldquo;That about lets us out.
We&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look there!&rdquo; he exclaimed suddenly.
&ldquo;Even the gypsies are taking to the air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment a stout dark-faced woman,
wearing the typical gypsy garb, broad, bright-colored
skirt and dazzling silk scarf tied about
her head, was alighting from a small cabin-type
monoplane. The plane was like a huge
dragon fly. It had a bottle-green body and silver
wings that glistened like glass in the sun.</p>
<p>The stout, dark woman was followed by a
girl of some eight years. And after her, in a
pilot&rsquo;s garb, came a golden-haired girl who did
not look a day over eighteen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange!&rdquo; Rosemary&rsquo;s tone expressed
her surprise. &ldquo;I saw those same people in Chicago,
just before we took off. And now, here
they are right with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so strange,&rdquo; replied the pilot. &ldquo;That
giant bug of hers may be quite speedy. They
probably took off later than we did and just in
time to miss the storm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But look!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;If that sort of
thing is allowed to go on, what is to come of
this bright new thing we call aviation? There&rsquo;ll
be a crack-up every day in the week. The papers
will be full of them and no one will dare
to travel by air. And all that because of rank
amateurs and lax regulations. I&rsquo;m starting an
investigation right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice plane you have,&rdquo; he said to the golden-haired
girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, but perhaps a little too small.&rdquo; The
girl spoke with a pleasing foreign accent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not a gypsy?&rdquo; The veteran pilot
smiled in spite of himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But no.&rdquo; The girl smiled back. &ldquo;Not entirely.
I am French. People call me Petite
Jeanne. I was adopted by gypsies in France.
Oh so good, Christian gypsies! This lady is
Mrs. Bihari, my foster mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said Mark with a laugh, &ldquo;that
you traded a flivver for an automobile, the auto
for a better one, the better one for a poor airplane,
the poor plane for a good one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But no!&rdquo; The golden-haired girl frowned.
&ldquo;A year ago my own people were found in
France. I had inherited property. This is my
very own plane. And see!&rdquo; She held out a
paper. &ldquo;This is my license to fly.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mind if I take your ship up for a little
spin?&rdquo; Mark said bluntly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But no.&rdquo; The girl spoke slowly. &ldquo;That is,
if I may go, and if she will go with us.&rdquo; She
nodded her head toward Rosemary.</p>
<p>Rosemary had little desire to fly in a small
plane. She had always traveled in the magnificent
big bi-motored transportation planes
which, she believed, were safe as walking. She
had it on the tip of her tongue to refuse, when
the girl cast her an appealing look that she
could not well disregard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;yes, surely I will go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three minutes later they were in the air. Ten
minutes later, with a sigh of relief Rosemary
found her feet once more on the solid earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d be surprised!&rdquo; Mark whispered enthusiastically.
&ldquo;Never saw a better equipped
plane, nor one in finer condition. That motor
is a joy! The radio is perfect. Everything, just
everything. If all the amateurs were as careful
this world of the air would be one great big
joy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful little plane!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
gripping the little French girl&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;And
how wonderfully cared for!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But why not?&rdquo; The girl showed all her
white teeth in a smile. &ldquo;We gypsy people have
a saying, &lsquo;Life is God&rsquo;s most beautiful gift to
man.&rsquo; This is true, I am sure. Then why
should anyone do less than the very best that
he might keep that gift?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why indeed? And thanks for the good
word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you travel much?&rdquo; It was a new voice
that asked this question. The rather mysterious
Danby Force had come up unobserved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes! We are gypsies. All gypsies travel
much,&rdquo; was the girl&rsquo;s reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where will you go next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over the mountains to Cheyenne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, then you will be going part way back
the way we came,&rdquo; Danby Force said. There
was an eager note in his voice. &ldquo;I wonder if it
would be possible for you to take a passenger
and to pause for a brief time at a safe landing
field?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>Rosemary started. So Danby Force meant
to return. He was going back to the lodge.
Had he, after all, taken the dark-faced lady&rsquo;s
bag? Had he hidden it there? Would he return
and carry it away? If so, why? Why?
Such were the questions that crowded her
mind. And she did not like them. She <i>did</i> like
Danby Force. She wanted to believe that he
was incapable of doing a thing dishonest or
dishonorable. She had not forgotten his delightful
words about God&rsquo;s invisible power in
our lives.</p>
<p>But the little French girl was speaking. &ldquo;If
it will help someone,&rdquo; she was saying. &ldquo;We
will take you over the mountains and stop at
this safe place you speak of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will help&mdash;help a great deal, I assure
you!&rdquo; Danby Force exclaimed. &ldquo;It may help
three thousand people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There it is again,&rdquo; Rosemary thought. &ldquo;Always
speaking of thousands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might as well get over to the airport,&rdquo;
Mark, the pilot, suggested to Rosemary. &ldquo;The
dark lady has had ample time to lodge her complaint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went, but much to their surprise found
that no complaint had been filed. What was
more, the dark lady had vanished. No one
about the place could tell them how she had
gone, nor where.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the strangest business I ever had anything
to do with!&rdquo; Mark grumbled. &ldquo;Loses her
bag, valuable papers and all, and still no complaint.
But believe me!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve
not heard the last of this!&rdquo; Nor had they.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER III</span>
<br />THE &ldquo;FLYING CORNTASSEL&rdquo;</h2>
<p>The evening after her arrival in Salt Lake
City, Rosemary Sample, the young airplane
stewardess, overheard a conversation
that interested her greatly and at the same
time strengthened her faith in the rather mysterious
young man, Danby Force.</p>
<p>She might have thought of herself as an
eavesdropper had not the incident occurred in
that most public of all public places, the lobby
of a large hotel, the Hotel Temple Square.
Not that she was staying at so expensive a
place. Far from that, she occupied a room in
a clean, modest-priced rooming house. But
Rosemary had a weakness for large downy
chairs, soft lights, expensive draperies and all
that and, since at this time of year this hotel
was not crowded, she could see no reason why
she might not indulge these tastes for an hour
or two at least.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>She was buried deep in a heavily upholstered
chair, thinking dreamily of her home in Kansas,
of her mother, father, and the young people
of the old crowd back home. She was smiling
at the name they had given her, &ldquo;The Flying
Corntassel of Kansas,&rdquo; when, chancing to
look up, she beheld a vision of beauty all
wrapped in deep purple and white. To her
astonishment she realized that this was none
other than the flying gypsy&rsquo;s adopted daughter
who called herself Petite Jeanne. She wore a
long cape of purple cloth trimmed with white
fox fur.</p>
<p>At the same moment someone else caught
the vision, Danby Force. And Danby Force
had something to say about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a gorgeous cape, and what marvelous
color!&rdquo; he exclaimed. There was in his tone not
a trace of flattery. He spoke with the sincerity
of one who really knows beauty of texture
when he sees it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the little French girl agreed, &ldquo;it is
very beautiful. It was sent to me only last
month by my gypsy friends in France. Since
I have had a little money I have helped them
at times. Their life is hard. These days are
very hard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The cloth,&rdquo; she went on after a time, &ldquo;was
woven by hand from pure sheep&rsquo;s wool taken
from the high French Alps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the color?&rdquo; Danby Force asked eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah-h&mdash;&rdquo; the little French girl smiled.
&ldquo;That is a deep secret that only the gypsies
know. There are those who say the kettle of
color only boils at midnight and that then the
color is mixed with blood. That is nonsense.
These are good gypsies, Christian gypsies, just
as the great preacher, Gypsy Smith was. But
they have their secrets and they keep them
well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; she added after a moment&rsquo;s
thought, &ldquo;this is the royal purple one reads of
in the Bible. Who can tell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Danby Force, &ldquo;is a valuable secret.&rdquo;
He motioned the little French girl to a
seat and took one close beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know a man,&rdquo; he said after a moment of
silence, &ldquo;who made some valuable discoveries
regarding colors. He could dye cloth in such
a manner that it would not fade, yet the process
was not costly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This man had spent his boyhood in a town
where textile mills had flourished. After his
remarkable secret discoveries he returned to
that town to find the people idle, the mills falling
into decay. The weaving industry had
moved south where there was cotton and
cheap labor&mdash;pitifully cheap!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Danby Force paused to stare at the pattern
of the thick carpet on the floor. He appeared
to be making a mental comparison between
that carpet and the cheap rag rugs on the
floors in that forgotten town.</p>
<p>Rosemary stole a look at the little French
girl&rsquo;s face. It was all compassion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this little forgotten town?&rdquo; suggested
Petite Jeanne at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is forgotten no longer.&rdquo; Danby Force
smiled a rare smile. &ldquo;The man who possessed
those rare secrets of color gave them to his
home town. Since they were able to produce
cloth that was cheap, and better than any other
of its kind, the mills began to flourish again
and the people to work and smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now,&rdquo; he added as a shadow passed
over his interesting face, &ldquo;their prosperity is
threatened once more.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>Then, as if he had been about to divulge a
forbidden secret, he sprang to his feet. &ldquo;I must
be going. We leave at eight. That right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is quite right,&rdquo; agreed Petite Jeanne.</p>
<p>Rosemary Sample went to her rest that
night with a strange sense of futile longing
gnawing at her heart. What was its cause?
She could not tell. Had she become truly interested
in that strange young man, Danby
Force, who talked so beautifully of God&rsquo;s unseen
power, who spoke of doing good to thousands,
and yet who might have&mdash;. She would
not say it even to herself, yet she could not
avoid thinking. Could she become seriously
interested in such a young man? She could
not be sure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That charming little French girl is carrying
him away in the morning,&rdquo; she assured
herself. &ldquo;I may never see him again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is going back to the hunting lodge. I
wonder&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She tried to picture in her mind the bit of
life&rsquo;s drama that would be enacted by Danby
Force and the little French girl after they had
landed and gone down the narrow trail to the
lodge. In the midst of this rather vain imagining
she fell asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>She awoke next morning prepared for one
more journey through the air, one more group
of passengers. &ldquo;Wonder if there will be any
interesting ones?&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Wonder if
that dark-faced woman will return with me?&rdquo;
She shuddered. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s like a raven, Poe&rsquo;s raven.
Wonder if she&rsquo;s filed a complaint about
her missing bag. And if she has, what will
come of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After oatmeal, coffee and rolls eaten at a
counter with the capable and ever friendly
Mark Morris at her side, she felt well fortified
for the day&rsquo;s adventures, come what might.</p>
<p>We advertise our occupation in life by the
posture we assume. The barber has his way
of standing that marks him as a barber. The
clerk of a department store puts on a mask in
the morning and takes it off at night. The posture
of an airplane stewardess is one suggesting
the jaunty joy of life pictured by a blue
bird on the tiptop of a tree, seventy feet in air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Safe?&rdquo; her posture says plainer than words.
&ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s safe to fly. Look at me, I&rsquo;ve
flown four hundred thousand miles.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>Rosemary Sample was an airplane stewardess
to the very tips of her fingers. Her task
was a dual one, to inspire confidence and to
entertain. She did both extremely well. Yet
she too must be entertained. She must receive
a thrill now and again. Riding in a plane
brought no thrill to her. Only her passengers
could bring her the change she craved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s always one,&rdquo; she had a way of saying
to her friends, &ldquo;one passenger who is worth
five hours of study.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was not long in finding the &ldquo;one&rdquo; on
this journey back to Chicago. Strangely
enough, he took the seat vacated by the dark-complexioned
lady. Yet, how different he was!
He was young, not much over twenty, Rosemary
thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, little girl!&rdquo; were his first words.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rosemary Sample.&rdquo; She smiled because
she was saying to herself, &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll do the talking.
That&rsquo;s fine. I&rsquo;m too tired to talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re a sample.&rdquo; He laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like
a dollar bottle of the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sample&rsquo;s all there is and all there can be,&rdquo;
she replied quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! You mean to say you couldn&rsquo;t
grow?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. Five feet four inches tall, weight
a hundred and twenty pounds. Those are the
regulations for a stewardess. You can be smaller,
but no larger. You see,&rdquo; she laughed, &ldquo;they
couldn&rsquo;t make the airplane cabins to fit the
stewardesses, tall, short, thin or thick, so the
stewardess must be picked to fit the cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; The young man&rsquo;s grin was frank,
honest and friendly. &ldquo;Well, this is my first
trip in these big birds. I&rsquo;ve got a little ship all
my own, only just now she&rsquo;s busted up quite
a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cracked up? Too bad!&rdquo; Rosemary was
truly sorry. She was going to like this passenger.
Besides, to one who sails the air a crack-up
is just as true an occasion for sorrow as a
shipwreck is to a mariner on the high seas.
&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; she asked quietly. &ldquo;Bad
storm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; He laughed lightly. &ldquo;Couple of struts
got loose. I nearly lost control two thousand
feet up. Cracked up in a corn field. Shucked
a lot of corn.&rdquo; He laughed rather loudly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>Rosemary&rsquo;s face was sober. She had seen
his kind before. They went in for flying because
it promised thrills. They neglected their
planes. If they crashed and were not killed,
they turned it into a joke. The whole thing
made her feel sick inside. She loved flying.
She thought of it as one of God&rsquo;s latest and
most marvelous gifts to man. She knew too
that nothing very short of perfection in care,
equipment and piloting could put it in the place
in every man&rsquo;s life where it belonged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you laugh at a crash that results from
carelessness?&rdquo; Her lips were white. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
the sort of thing that makes life hard for all
of us who are trying to make flying seem a safe
and wonderful thing. Nothing but selfishness
could make one laugh at a tragedy or a near
tragedy that is his own fault. It&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she stopped herself. After all, she was
a stewardess, being paid to be pleasant.</p>
<p>Springing to her feet, she moved up the
aisle to see that the airplane load of traveling
salesmen forward had the papers, pencils, magazines
and pillows they needed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re a sample,&rdquo; said the youth as she
returned to her seat. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know as I want
a full bottle after all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>&ldquo;In the end you&rsquo;ll take it.&rdquo; She was smiling
now. &ldquo;Or someone will be setting up a marble
marker where little Willie lies. And that,&rdquo; she
added slowly, &ldquo;would be too bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spoke, not of herself, but her attitude toward
aviation. He knew this. She could read
it in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tha&mdash;thanks for these few kind words,&rdquo; he
replied rather lamely.</p>
<p>Five minutes later this young man, who
went by the name of William VanGeldt and
whose family evidently were possessed of considerable
wealth, was speaking in glowing
tones of his mother. He had, the young stewardess
discovered, beneath his thin coating of
indifference to the serious things of life, a
warm heart full of appreciation for the ones
who had given of their best that his life might
be well worth living.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll take the full bottle,&rdquo; she whispered to
herself. &ldquo;And he&rsquo;ll get to like it.&rdquo; She was to
learn the truth of these words in days that
were to come.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER IV</span>
<br />WITH THE AID OF PROVIDENCE</h2>
<p>To the little French girl, Petite Jeanne,
each day dawned as a bright new adventure.
Mysteries might come and go, as indeed
they often had, but adventure! Ah yes, adventure
was always with her.</p>
<p>Nor had her new treasure, the airplane with
its gauze-like wings, lessened her opportunity
for adventure. Indeed it had increased it tenfold.
To Rosemary Sample one might say,
&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re off to another airplane journey,&rdquo;
and she undoubtedly would answer with a
sigh, &ldquo;Yes, one more trip.&rdquo; Not so Petite
Jeanne. She was not reckless, this slender child
of the air. Her motor was inspected often, each
guy and strut tested, her radio tuned to the last
degree of perfection. For all that, each day as
she took to the air it was with such a leaping
of the heart as comes only with fresh adventure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>And so it was that, as she climbed into the
cockpit, with Madame Bihari, Danby Force,
and the tiny gypsy girl at her back, she
touched the controls of her perfect little plane
for all the world as if never before had her
fingers known that touch. And as, after skimming
along the air above the foothills, she began
climbing toward one lone snowy peak
among the Rockies, her heart was filled to
overflowing with a fresh zest for living.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just to live,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;to live, to
love, to dream, to hope and sometimes see our
hopes fulfilled! To see the dew on the grass in
the early morning, to hear the robins chirping
in the early evening, to watch children play, to
feel the wind playing in your hair, to feel the
warm sunshine kiss your cheeks, to watch the
red and gold of evening sky. Ah yes, and to
watch that snowy peak just before me, watch it
grow and grow and grow&mdash;that is <i>life</i>&mdash;<i>beautiful,
wonderful, glorious life!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The airplane, which might have seemed to
one far away a giant silver insect, went gliding
about the white capped mountain to drop at
last with scarcely a bump upon that landing
field that had at other times been a pasture
above the clouds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>How convenient it would be if at times one&rsquo;s
spirit might, for a space of a half hour or more,
leave the body that, closing about it, holds it
in one place, and go with the speed of light to
distant scenes. The spirit of Rosemary Sample,
speeding away toward Chicago, might for
a quarter hour or more have been spared from
the great trans-continental airplane. No one
surely would have begrudged so faithful a
worker such a short period of recreation. And
surely Rosemary would have been thrilled by
the opportunity of following our little company
on the mountain crest as they left
Jeanne&rsquo;s plane and followed the trail winding
down to the hunting lodge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>Had the spirit of Rosemary truly been with
them, she must surely have been asking herself,
&ldquo;Why is Danby Force here? What does
he expect to find at the lodge? Did he take the
dark lady&rsquo;s traveling bag? Is it hidden there?
Will he find it? And if he does, what will he
take from it? &lsquo;Valuable papers&rsquo; were the dark
lady&rsquo;s words. Were there such papers? There
is some relation between this fine-appearing
young man and that lady. What can it be?&rdquo;
So the spirit of Rosemary Sample might have
spoken to itself had it followed down the
mountainside. But the spirit of Rosemary Sample
was not there. Rosemary Sample, body,
soul and spirit, was in the trans-continental
plane speeding on toward Chicago. And beside
her, now talking loudly and boastfully of his
dangerous exploits as an amateur aviator, and
now speaking in kindly and gentle tones of
his mother, was young Willie VanGeldt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should not care for him at all,&rdquo; Rosemary
told herself. Yet there was something about
him, his light and good-natured views of life,
his smile perhaps, something about him that
claimed her interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if the stars had willed that for a time
our lives should run together, like trains on
parallel tracks,&rdquo; she whispered to herself. Little
did she guess the part that this youth with
his wealth and his reckless ways would play in
her life, nor that which she would play in his.</p>
<p class="tb">In the meantime Jeanne, Danby Force and
their gypsy companions were wending their
way down the trail that led to the hunting
lodge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t detain you long,&rdquo; Danby Force was
saying to Jeanne. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a little thing I
want to look into up here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanne, whose curiosity had not as yet been
aroused, scarcely heard him. She was awed
and charmed by the grandeur and beauty of
the mountains. To look up two thousand feet
to the snow-clad rocks that were the mountain
peaks, then to look down quite as far to the
tree-grown canyons far below&mdash;ah that was
grand!</p>
<p>When at last they came in sight of the rustic
lodge, flanked as it was by massive rocks
and half covered by overhanging boughs of
evergreens, she stopped in her tracks to stand
there lost in admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;What a grand solitude
is here! Who would not wish to return
many, many times!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>She was soon enough to learn that it was
not solitude the interesting young man, Danby
Force, sought. For, contrary to Rosemary
Sample&rsquo;s suspicion, he had not hidden the dark
lady&rsquo;s traveling bag. He had returned to seek
it. How did he hope to succeed when, on that
other occasion, all others had failed? Well
may one ask. Yet Danby Force did not lack
for hope. He believed in a kind Providence
that sometimes guides an honest soul in its
search for hidden things. With the aid of this
Providence he might succeed where others had

<br />DANBY&rsquo;S SECRET</h2>
<p>Before leaving Salt Lake City, in accord
with the customs of all gypsies, Madame
Bihari and Jeanne had laid in a supply of provisions.
Having come upon them while in the
act, Danby Force had added a few luxuries to
the stock. They were therefore prepared for
a stay of some length if need be.</p>
<p>In spite of this, Danby Force said as he entered
the lodge, &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t be here long I
hope. I came to look for that bag.&rdquo; He favored
Jeanne with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, a mystery!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;A missing bag.
Was it yours? And how was it lost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Of course!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
know a thing about it! How stupid of me!
Sit down and I&rsquo;ll tell you about it. At least&mdash;&rdquo;
he hesitated, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you some things.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>Madame Bihari had kindled a fire in the
huge fireplace. The glow of it lighted up the
little French girl&rsquo;s face. It made her look extraordinarily
beautiful. Danby Force took in
a long breath before he began.</p>
<p>That which he told her after all was not so
very much&mdash;at least he did not tell her why he
was so intensely interested in that traveling
bag. He did tell her all that had passed in that
cabin on the previous day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you see,&rdquo; he ended, &ldquo;that the bag must
be here somewhere. You don&rsquo;t carry away a
leather bag a foot high and two feet long in
your mouth, nor inside your shoe either.&rdquo; The
little French girl joined him in a low laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But no!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;And yet I cannot
see how it could matter so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the papers in that bag,&rdquo; he explained.
&ldquo;She did not steal those papers, that dark lady.
She is no common thief. They are hers in a
way. And yet she could use them to ruin the
prosperity and happiness of three thousand
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why would she do such a terrible
thing?&rdquo; The little French girl spread her hands
in horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are reasons. She is a truly bad woman,&rdquo;
he said briefly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I will help you.&rdquo; On Petite Jeanne&rsquo;s face
was written a great desire. &ldquo;And these others
I will help if I can.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To do something for others&mdash;&rdquo; she spoke
slowly. &ldquo;To really do things and to love doing
them! Ah, there is the key to all true happiness!
In the terrible times that are passing,
if we have learned this, then it is worth while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Danby Force, taking her slender
hand in a solemn grip. &ldquo;It <i>is</i> worth it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But come!&rdquo; Jeanne sprang to her feet. &ldquo;We
must find this so important bag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where,&rdquo; she asked a moment later, &ldquo;did
this lady sleep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In here.&rdquo; Danby Force led the way to the
bunk room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In which bunk?&rdquo; Jeanne insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that one. I can&rsquo;t be sure.&rdquo; Danby
Force pointed to the darkest corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we gypsies are camping in tents,&rdquo;
said Jeanne, &ldquo;when we are afraid of thieves,
we put the things we treasure most at the bottom
of our bed where no one can touch them
without touching our toes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After casting the gleam of a flashlight upon
the bunk Danby Force had indicated, she
seized the blankets and threw them back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>At once an exclamation escaped Danby&rsquo;s
lips:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bag!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was true. There, well flattened out beneath
the blankets, lay a flexible leather traveling
bag. When he had seized upon it, the
young man found it unlocked and empty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She tricked me,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;The bag
was not lost. It was hidden. She put on the
extra clothes she carried and wore them beneath
a long coat. She carried the papers in
some concealed pockets. By pretending that
the bag was lost she has thrown me completely
off her track.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was not sure&mdash;&rdquo; He was speaking slowly,
calmly now. &ldquo;I could not be sure that she was
what we suspected her of being. I had been
away from our plant when she was employed
there. I did not believe she knew me, so I followed
her. This act, this hiding of the bag
proves that she is the person we thought her
and that she did know me. Now she has escaped
me. She is gone. Who can say how or
where? The trail is old by now. I cannot follow
her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>Moving slowly, like one in a dream, he retraced
his steps to his place by the fire, then
sank gloomily into a chair. For a long time
he sat staring into the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do something for someone else,&rdquo; he murmured
after poking the fire until it glowed red.
&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the thing. That should be the
slogan of our generation&mdash;do something for
someone else. But when there are those who
block all your efforts, what then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked up for a moment. By chance his
gaze fell upon a broad window. Through that
window one&rsquo;s eyes beheld a magnificent sight&mdash;the
topmost peak of the mountain&rsquo;s jagged
crest, rearing high in all its glory.</p>
<p>For a full moment the young man&rsquo;s gaze remained
fixed upon this crown of beauty. Then
in a voice mellowed by reverence, he murmured:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills</p>
<p class="t">From whence cometh my help.</p>
<p class="t0">My strength cometh from the Lord</p>
<p class="t">Which made heaven and earth.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to tell you,&rdquo; he said, turning to
the little French girl. &ldquo;Perhaps you can help
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can but try,&rdquo; Petite Jeanne&rsquo;s tone was
deep and serious.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I told you of the man who made priceless
discoveries regarding color.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanne leaned far forward to listen. In the
corner the gypsy woman sat stolid in silence.
The child was playing with some bright feathers
in a spot of sunlight on the floor. The place
was very still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes,&rdquo; the little French girl whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I told you he returned to his home
town to find it in desolation and that he gave
his precious secrets to his town, and how it
prospered after that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have told me,&rdquo; replied Petite Jeanne,
&ldquo;but you have not told all. Were you the discoverer
of these rare colors?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;?&rdquo; The word came in shocked surprise.
&ldquo;No, it was not I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a period of silence. Then in a
voice raised scarcely above a whisper he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was my father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; the little French girl breathed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He made these discoveries while serving as
an industrial chemist in the Great War,&rdquo; Danby
Force went on after a time. &ldquo;The war was
terrible for him. He was gassed. He did not
live many years. There&mdash;there&rsquo;s a library in
his town now, a splendid tribute to his memory.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And I&mdash;&rdquo; he spoke slowly. &ldquo;I, his only son,
have tried to guard his secrets well. But now
it seems I am about to fail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you have not. Not yet?&rdquo; The little
French girl&rsquo;s tone was eager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, perhaps not yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you shall not!&rdquo; Petite Jeanne sprang
to her feet. &ldquo;I shall help you. We all can help.
This young lady, this stewardess you have told
me of, she travels far. She can watch. But
tell me,&rdquo; she demanded eagerly, &ldquo;tell me of this
dark-faced woman. One must know much if
one is to be truly helpful.&rdquo; She sank back into
her chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That woman!&rdquo; Danby&rsquo;s tone became animated.
&ldquo;I am convinced that she is an industrial
spy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An industrial spy?&rdquo; Jeanne&rsquo;s eyes opened
wide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. An industrial spy is one who makes it
his business to spy out the secret processes of
his fellow workers, then to sell these secrets to
others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes he is one of your fellow countrymen.
More often he is from another land. In
these days of extreme difficulty and great
struggle to make goods cheaply and to sell in
many markets, there are many, many spies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At first we trusted this woman. For three
months she was employed in our factory. And
to think&mdash;&rdquo; springing to his feet, he began pacing
the floor. &ldquo;To think that all that time she
was spying out secrets that rightly belong to
our people!</p>
<p>&ldquo;These spies!&rdquo; he exclaimed bitterly. &ldquo;They
fasten cameras beneath their jackets. A tiny
lens is concealed as a button. They take pictures,
hundreds of them. They make drawings.
If they may, they carry away secret receipts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did that woman do all this?&rdquo; Jeanne asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not sure that she has the secret formula.
If she has not, then all may not be lost.
And yet, she may have all the information
needed. If she has, she will carry it back to
her own country and we are ruined, for hers
is a land where the poor slave long hours for
little pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must find her!&rdquo; the little French girl
exclaimed. &ldquo;We shall, I am sure of that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we must find her,&rdquo; Danby agreed. &ldquo;It
is known that she is an alien in this country
without passport. If only she can be found, she
may be sent back to her own country with
pockets empty as far as industrial secrets are
concerned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, as if he wished to forget it all for a
little space of time, that he might revel in the
comfort and natural beauty of his surroundings,
Danby Force shook himself, glanced
away at the snow-capped mountains, then
dropped into a chair to sit musing before the
glowing fire.</p>
<p>The little French girl had wandered to the
back of the cabin. Presently he heard her light
footsteps approaching. Looking up suddenly,
he caught a vision of pure loveliness. Jeanne
had slipped over her shoulders the purple cape
with its faultless white fox collar. Just at that
instant she was standing by a window where
the light turned her hair into pure gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&mdash;how perfect!&rdquo; he breathed. &ldquo;But
why so pensive?&rdquo; he asked as he caught a
glimpse of her face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking,&rdquo; said Jeanne slowly. &ldquo;Wondering.
Should you lose your precious secrets,
then perhaps I might coax the secret of this
royal purple from my gypsy friends. That
would help you. Is it not so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; he agreed eagerly. &ldquo;It would
help a great deal!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But would it be right?&rdquo; Jeanne&rsquo;s brow
wrinkled. &ldquo;In France there are many poor
gypsies, thousands perhaps, who weave cloth
and dye it too. If the secret were lost to them,
then perhaps they would go hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Danby Force, &ldquo;requires much
thinking. We must do no wrong. And we <i>must</i>
find that woman!&rdquo; He sprang from his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Jeanne agreed. &ldquo;We must! But first
we must eat.&rdquo; She laughed a merry laugh.
&ldquo;See! Our good Madame Bihari has prepared
a gypsy feast. I am sure you will enjoy it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Danby Force did enjoy that feast. A meat
pie filled with all sorts of strange and delicious
flavors, a drink that was not quite hot chocolate
nor quite anything else, thin cakes baked
on the coals, and after that fruit and bonbons.
What wonder they lingered over the repast&mdash;lingered
indeed too long, for, when at last they
stepped from the doorway all the mellow sunshine
had vanished and in its place dark clouds,
like massive trains with huge silently rolling
wheels were moving up the mountainside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; Jeanne clapped her hands. &ldquo;Now
we shall remain in this most wonderful place
all night. And Madame Bihari, she shall tell
your fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My fortune?&rdquo; The young man stared at
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But yes!&rdquo; Jeanne did not laugh. &ldquo;You are
in trouble. There are many things you wish
to know. To be sure you must have your fortune
told. And Madame Bihari, she tells fortunes
beautifully, I assure you!&rdquo; She went
dancing, light as a fairy across the broad
veranda to disappear like some woods sprite
along a winding trail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER VI</span>
<br />THE GYPSY WITCH CARDS</h2>
<p>So that evening Danby Force consented to
have his fortune told. Being a practical
young man who thought in terms of dollars
and cents, and seldom found time for dreaming,
he was not likely to take the matter seriously.
Why did he consent? Perhaps it was
because he liked Petite Jeanne and wished to
please her. And then again there may have
been in his nature, as there is in many another
practical person&rsquo;s, a feeling for the mysterious,
the thing that cannot be entirely explained.
And who can say that this race of wanderers,
these gypsies, may not have hidden away in
their breasts some secrets unknown to others?
Surely, as we have seen, they could make a
cape of royal purple such as is known among
no other people. Whatever the reason, Danby
Force consented to have his fortune told.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>That night the great lounge of the hunting
lodge presented to Jeanne a setting both weird
and wonderful. She loved it. Flames in the
great fireplace sent shadows chasing one another
from beam to beam of the ceiling. Two
candles, one at each end of the long table, casting
each its yellow gleam, brought out the
handsome smiling face of Danby Force, but
left Madame Bihari in all but complete darkness.
From the mantel above the fire came the
slow tick-tock of a clock. Once, from without,
the girl thought she caught the challenging cry
of some wild thing, perhaps a wolf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said Madame Bihari, looking up at
Danby Force, &ldquo;are the cards. You shall shuffle
them, my young friend. You shall cut them
with your left hand. Then you shall place
them on the table in positions I shall tell you
of.&rdquo; Madame Bihari talked at this moment just
as Jeanne had always imagined a wooden man
might talk, each word spoken in the same low,
slow tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are the cards,&rdquo; Jeanne thought to
herself. Yes, there they were. How many times
she had watched Madame Bihari tell fortunes
from those cards! As she closed her eyes she
could see some rich and dignified dame, at the
steps of a castle in France, spread out those
same cards, then sit intent, motionless, expectant
as Madame Bihari told her fortune.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And how cleverly she tells them!&rdquo; Jeanne
whispered to herself. &ldquo;There was the Chateau
Buraine. Madame said, &lsquo;It will be destroyed
by fire.&rsquo; Two months later it was in ashes. And
the gypsies did not set the fire. <i>Mais</i> no! No!
They were all away at the Paris Fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now&mdash;&rdquo; Madame was speaking once more
to Danby. &ldquo;Now you have shuffled, you have
cut the cards. You shall now lay them face-up
in rows, six in the first row, then eight in a
row for five rows, and last, six in a row.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanne watched fascinated as the cards were
turned up. She knew those cards by heart.
Each had its number. On each card was a different
picture, a serpent, a sun, a moon, children
at play, a house, a cloud, a tree, a mouse,
a bear; yes, yes, there were pictures and each
picture had its meaning, a good prophecy or a
bad one. Health, happiness, riches, love, enemies,
failure, deception, sickness, death&mdash;all
these and many more were prophesied by these
pictures.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>Most important of all was one card, the picture
of a gentleman in evening coat and tall,
starched collar. His number was 19. It was
this card that, in the next moment or two,
would stand for the young man, Danby Force.
Would he be surrounded by cards telling of
success, love and happiness, or by those telling
of dire misfortune? She held her breath as
Danby, his fingers trembling slightly, dealt the
cards.</p>
<p>Did Jeanne believe in all this? Had you
asked her, she would perhaps have found no
reply. She had lived long with the gypsies, had
Petite Jeanne. How could she escape believing?
And, after all, who would wish to escape?
Who is there in all the world that cares to say,
&ldquo;I know all about these things. There is no
truth in them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anyway, here was Madame Bihari, Danby
Force, Petite Jeanne. Here were the dancing
shadows. There were the cards. And there&mdash;Jeanne
caught her breath. Yes, there was the
man in evening dress. There was card number
19. Every card placed close to him must
have a very special meaning. Leaning back into
the shadows, she waited. When all the cards
were down, Madame Bihari would study them.
There would be a silence, three minutes, four,
five minutes long, then Madame would speak.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>In her eagerness to catch every word, Jeanne
moved close up beside Danby Force.</p>
<p>Silence followed, such a silence as makes a
roar of the wind singing down the chimney.
From the mountainside there came the whisper
of spruce trees. Torn, twisted, and tangled
by storms, those trees stood there like horrible
dwarfs whispering of love and life, of hatred
and death. Once Jeanne, moved by who knows
what impulse, went tip-toeing from her place
to press her nose against the glass and peer
into that darkness. Then, as if all the gnarled
trees had been shaking fists at her, she sprang
back to her place close to Danby Force.</p>
<p>When at last Madame Bihari broke the
silence, she spoke in a deep melodious tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah. The snake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The snake!&rdquo; Jeanne murmured low. She
shuddered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he is not too near.&rdquo; There was a measure
of relief in Madame&rsquo;s tone. &ldquo;And see!
Between Monsieur and the snake is the Book.
Ah! That is good! The Book stands for mystery
that shall be solved. And the Eye!&rdquo; Her
tone became animated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! The Eye!&rdquo; Jeanne was smiling now,
for well she knew that the Eye betokened great
interest taken by friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friends,&rdquo; she whispered to Danby Force,
when Madame had told of the Eye, &ldquo;Friends,
they are everything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Danby&rsquo;s tone was full of meaning.
&ldquo;Friends, loyal friends, they are worth more
than all else in this life! And, thank God, I
have many friends!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And see!&rdquo; Madame exclaimed. &ldquo;Here is
the Moon. A very good sign.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the fox! Ah, this is bad! This speaks
of distrust. There are those, Monsieur, whom
you must not trust too much&mdash;perhaps some
who are very close to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madame did not permit the young man to
finish. &ldquo;The Sun!&rdquo; Her face darkened. &ldquo;The
Sun tells of future vexation.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder.&rdquo; Danby Force
laughed. &ldquo;Indeed I have had quite a lot of
that already. But come! I shall be having the
jitters from all this evil prophecy. Let&rsquo;s get
our little blonde-haired friend to make us a
steaming cup of chocolate, and please put in
just one spoonful of malted milk and a marshmallow.&rdquo;
He touched Jeanne&rsquo;s golden locks
gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But one moment!&rdquo; Madame protested.
&ldquo;Here is the pig close at hand. He tells of
great abundance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps that means that I am to have two
cups of chocolate.&rdquo; Danby laughed once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But yes!&rdquo; Jeanne joined him in the laugh.
&ldquo;Three if you say so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One moment more, I pray you!&rdquo; Madame&rsquo;s
tone was very earnest. &ldquo;I read in these cards
that there is one who calls himself your friend.
He has dark and curly hair. He smiles. He
dances. He is very much alive. But ah! He
is a rascal! You must beware!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall beware. Thank you,&rdquo; Danby said
soberly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now!&rdquo; exclaimed Jeanne, springing to
her feet, &ldquo;Our cup of cheer!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>When their light repast was over, when
Madame sat nodding by the fire that had
burned low, Jeanne spoke to Danby Force in
words of exceeding soberness. &ldquo;You must not
treat too lightly Madame&rsquo;s forecast with the
cards. Indeed you must not! She is old. She
has told fortunes since she was a child. The
rich and the very great, they have listened
often to her fortunes. Truly they have.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once&mdash;&rdquo; her voice dropped to a whisper.
&ldquo;Once she said to a man, a very great man
who lived in a castle on a hill: &lsquo;You shall die.
In two months you will be dead.&rsquo; And in two
months his heart stopped. He was dead, dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some time after that she sat staring at
the fire. When she spoke again it was in a
changed tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you, my friend, you did not have a
bad fortune. Indeed not! There were troubles.
They come to all. You will overcome them.
There were those you must not trust. You
will discover that they are traitors. In the end
you shall have honor, perhaps much money,
and always I am sure&mdash;&rdquo; her voice dropped,
&ldquo;Always you shall have many, many friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah yes,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Please, dear little
French girl, many friends!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, for a long time, with the fire
gleaming brightly before them and the murmur
of the wild out-of-doors coming down the
chimney to them, they sat reading their own
fortunes in the flames.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER VII</span>
<br />A STRANGE BATTLE</h2>
<p>In the meantime the little stewardess, Rosemary
Sample, had made her way back to
Chicago. During the time Danby Force was
having his fortune told she was thinking at
intervals of him. She was in her own small
room and, as one will, whose mind is not actively
engaged in performing a task, she was
thinking of many things. Rosemary was, by
nature, romantic. Contrary to general opinion,
there are few romances between pilots of the
air and their lady companions. Pilots, as a
rule, are married men with homes they love all
the more dearly because of enforced absence
from them. Rosemary had been obliged to
find romance, if any, from contact with her
passengers. And there had been romances of
a sort, though none of serious import. She
smiled now as she thought of the great banker
who more than once had favored her with a
smile; of the movie actor, little more than a
boy, who had traveled on her ship, once every
week for four months. &ldquo;Such a nice boy,&rdquo; she
whispered. &ldquo;He&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>Her thoughts broke off. She listened intently.
Over her head was clamped a head-set for receiving
messages. Her radio was in tune with
the sending sets of all her company&rsquo;s great
fleet of airplanes. What message did she expect
to receive? Often none in particular. She loved
the general chatter of the air. &ldquo;Plane Number
9 taking off from Chicago to New York.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Plane Number 34 due in Cheyenne at 9:15,
twenty minutes late.&rdquo; &ldquo;Plane Number 11
grounded by a storm near Troy, New York.&rdquo;
All this was music to her ears, for was she not
part of it all, the great air-transportation system,
not of tomorrow, but of today?</p>
<p>Tonight, however, she half expected a personal
message. To each of six friends, all
stewardesses of the air, she had told what she
knew of the dark lady. To each she had said,
&ldquo;If she boards your ship, give my call number
and let me know. I&rsquo;ll be listening till time
for sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>The message that for the instant held her
attention proved disappointing. It was not
for her. So she went on with her dreaming.
And in those dreams there frequently appeared
two faces&mdash;a serious one, Danby Force, and a
smiling one, Willie VanGeldt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How different they are!&rdquo; she thought to
herself. &ldquo;And yet, if I am not mistaken each
has been, or will be, heir to a large fortune. It
seems that even rich people have their own
way of living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These thoughts did not long hold her fancy.
Soon she was dreaming of trips she would
make in the future. No, not trips from Chicago
to New York, then New York to Chicago.
Nothing like that, but long trips into strange
places. She&rsquo;d collect a pocketful of passes and
go wandering. She&rsquo;d catch a ship across the
Canadian prairies to Edmonton, take the north
going plane and land at last at the mouth of
the Mackenzie River on the shore of the Arctic.
There she&rsquo;d play with brown Eskimo
babies and tame seals. She would drive dog
teams and reindeer, ride in skin-boats and perhaps&mdash;just
perhaps&mdash;hunt polar bear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>When she tired of all this, she&rsquo;d go flying
south through the air, south to Cuba,
Panama, Rio and the slow-moving Amazon.
Ah yes, this airplane business was quite wonderful,
if only you knew how to make the most
of it. And she knew. Ah yes, she, Rosemary
Sample, knew.</p>
<p>But first there were other matters to be considered.
Willie VanGeldt and his badly cared
for little flivver of the air; Danby Force and
his dark lady. And&mdash;and&mdash;</p>
<p>Well, what of the rest? Rosemary had fallen
asleep.</p>
<p>She awoke a half hour later and remained
so just long enough to remove the head-set,
shut off her radio, slip out of her day clothes
and into her dream robes. Then again she fell
fast asleep.</p>
<p class="tb">The charming little gypsy child who, in her
bright colored dress and purple headdress
looked more like an animated doll than a child,
played little part in the bit of life drama played
at the crest of the mountain by Petite Jeanne
and her friends until, after breakfast of bacon,
toast and delicious coffee, the members of the
party left the hunting lodge to wend their way
up the mountainside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>They were approaching the skyline landing
field. A sharp, bleak wind, whispering of approaching
winter, cut at their cheeks and tore
away at the broken and twisted fir trees that
made up the advance guard of timberline.</p>
<p>The little gypsy girl was in the lead. Of a
sudden she paused and, pointing excitedly, exclaimed,
&ldquo;See! Teddy bears! And do look!
They are alive! One of them stuck his tongue
out at me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The older members of the party did not
share the little girl&rsquo;s happy animation. To
their consternation they discovered two grizzly
bear cubs half hidden among the rocks not a
dozen paces away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; said Madame, seizing the child&rsquo;s
hand. There was a quaver of fear in her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; The child Vida&rsquo;s round face
suddenly took on a sober look. &ldquo;They are
pretty bears. And they are alive. I know
they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanne too knew they were alive, and Danby
Force knew. They also realized that bear-cub
twins usually had a mother close by, and a
mother bear spelled trouble.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we&rsquo;ve got to get out of here!&rdquo; Danby&rsquo;s
words were low, but tense with emotion.
The airplane was still a quarter of a mile
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; Madame voiced a sharp command
as the child hung back. Next moment the
child found herself on Danby&rsquo;s shoulder, and
they were all hurrying away toward their
plane.</p>
<p>Jeanne&rsquo;s heart had gone into a tailspin. Were
they going to make it? Was the mother bear
close at hand, or had she gone some distance
in her search for food?</p>
<p>One glance back gave Jeanne the answer.
&ldquo;Run! Run!&rdquo; She uttered the words before
she thought them.</p>
<p>Instantly they sprang into wild flight.</p>
<p>Bears are swift runners. This mother was
no exception. Had someone been standing upon
a rock overlooking the scene, he might have
discovered that the bear, almost at a bound,
had shortened the distance between herself
and the fleeing ones by half. He would have
opened his eyes in sheer terror as he saw her,
mouth open, tongue lolling out, white teeth
gleaming, gaining yard by yard until it seemed
her breath would burn the sturdy gypsy
woman&rsquo;s cheek.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>Jeanne led the procession. Danby Force
came next. Madame, unaccustomed to running,
lagged behind.</p>
<p>Danby heard the beast&rsquo;s hoarse panting.
What was to happen? He had no weapon.
Yes, one, if it might be called that&mdash;a six-foot
stick. This stick was very hard and stout,
sharpened at one end. He had used it as an
Alpine staff. As Jeanne reached the plane he
threw the gypsy child into her hands; then
swinging about, he sprang to Madame&rsquo;s assistance.
He was not a moment too soon. The
irate beast was all but upon her.</p>
<p>At sight of this one who dared to turn and
face her, the bear paused, reared herself upon
her haunches and, for a space of ten seconds,
stood there, glaring, snarling, frothing at the
mouth.</p>
<p>The respite was brief. It was enough to
permit Jeanne to drag her foster mother into
the plane.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>Danby&rsquo;s thought as he turned to face the
bear had been that he might set the stick at
such an angle as to bring it into contact with
the bear&rsquo;s ribs as she charged. He had heard
of hunters practicing this trick. In the end his
courage failed him. Seeing his chance he
dropped the stick, sprang for the plane, fell
through the opening then slammed the door
after him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Safe!&rdquo; he breathed thickly. &ldquo;But is the
battle over? Perhaps it has but begun. She&mdash;she
could wreck this plane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh my poor Dragon Fly!&rdquo; Jeanne groaned.
The great beast hurled herself against the
stout door with such a shock as set the whole
ship to quivering.</p>
<p>Consternation was written on every face but
one in that small cabin. And why not? If
their plane were wrecked, what then? Danby
Force was in a hurry to get away. Every moment
counted. The happiness of an entire
community was at stake. Then too the breath
of winter was in the air. At any moment a
wild blizzard, sweeping in from the north,
might send snow whirling into every crack
and cranny of the mountain. Burying trails,
filling canyons with fathomless depths of snow,
it might shut them away from all the outside
world.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>In spite of this, one face was beaming, one
pair of sturdy legs were hopping about in high
glee. The gypsy child&rsquo;s joy knew no bounds.
&ldquo;Now there will be a fight!&rdquo; she screamed.
&ldquo;The big Dragon Fly has knives on his nose.
They are very sharp. They whirl round and
round. You cannot see them. The big bear
cannot see. The big Dragon Fly will bite the
big bear. He will roll down dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Listening to this wild chatter, Danby Force
received a sudden inspiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeanne, start your motor,&rdquo; he said in as
quiet a tone as he could command. &ldquo;She may
attack the propeller. If she does, goodbye
bear and goodbye propeller. I don&rsquo;t think she
will. We&rsquo;ll have to risk it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With lips drawn in a straight white line,
Jeanne took her place at the wheel, then set
the motor purring.</p>
<p>All prepared for a second lunge at the offending
box that held her fancied enemies, the
bear paused to listen.</p>
<p>Then, with a suddenness that was startling,
the motors let out a roar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; screamed Vida, the gypsy child.
&ldquo;The big Dragon Fly shouts at the bear. Now
she will run away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>The bear did not run away. Instead, she
turned half about to look away to the rocky
ridge where her cubs were hiding. Then it
was that Danby had one more brilliant idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeanne,&rdquo; he shouted in the little French
girl&rsquo;s ear, &ldquo;wheel your plane about, then start
taxiing slowly toward those cubs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanne&rsquo;s fingers trembled as she grasped one
control after another, to set her plane to do
Danby&rsquo;s bidding. &ldquo;What will be the result?&rdquo;
she was asking herself. Her great fear was that
the mother bear would leap at the propeller.
She had no desire to kill this mother, nor did
she wish to lose her propeller.</p>
<p>To Jeanne the result was astonishing. No
sooner had the &ldquo;giant insect,&rdquo; all made of
metal, started toward the rocks than the
mother bear, fearing no doubt for the safety
of her children, started to beat its time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A race!&rdquo; Vida shouted. &ldquo;Goody! A race!
And the big Dragon Fly will win!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was a greatly disappointed child when,
after following the bear for a short distance,
the plane swung round, increased its speed,
went circling about the narrow landing field;
then at Danby&rsquo;s shout, &ldquo;UP!&rdquo;, left the ground
to go sailing away among the clouds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Danby sighed as he settled back beside
Jeanne, &ldquo;we are out of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Jeanne sighed happily. &ldquo;We are out,
and the big Dragon Fly is safe!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>

<br />TRAILING AN OLD PAL</h2>
<p>That same evening Jeanne&rsquo;s giant dragon
fly came drifting sweetly down from the
clouds to land at the Chicago airport. After a
few words with Danby Force and a promise to
meet him before the airport depot on the following
day, she taxied her little plane into a
hangar, gave the mechanics some very definite
instructions regarding its care and general inspection,
then went away with her gypsy companions
to spend the night in a cozy Chicago
haunt of those dark brown wanderers, the
gypsies.</p>
<p>It was past mid-afternoon of the following
day when a large, rosy-cheeked girl came
striding along the path that leads to aviation
headquarters. Had you noted her jaunty
stride, the suggestion of strength that was in
her every movement, the joyous gleam of youth
that was in her eyes, you would have said:
&ldquo;This is our old friend Florence Huyler, her
very own self.&rdquo; And you would not have been
wrong.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>Had Petite Jeanne been there at that moment
she must surely have leapt straight into
her good pal&rsquo;s strong arms. They had been
separated for months, Jeanne had journeyed to
France. Florence had been adventuring in her
own land. Letters had gone astray, addresses
lost, so now here they were in the same great
city, but each ignorant of the other&rsquo;s nearness.
Would they meet? In a city of three million,
one seldom meets casually anyone one knows.</p>
<p>But here was Florence. She had come to the
airport with a definite purpose. She was, as
you will recall, a playground director. She had
tried her ability at many things, but this was
her true vocation. Times were hard. Playgrounds
had been closed. For the moment
Florence was unemployed. But was she downhearted?
Watch that smile, that jaunty tread.
Florence was young. Tomorrow was around
the corner and with it some opportunity for
work. Just at this moment an unusual occupation
had caught her fancy; she wished to become
an airplane stewardess. How Jeanne
would have laughed at this.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but my dear Florence!&rdquo; she would
have cried, &ldquo;You and your one hundred and
sixty pounds! You an airplane stewardess!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanne was not there, so Florence, marching
blissfully on, arrived in due time at the door
of aviation headquarters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if I might see Miss Marjory Monague?&rdquo;
she said to the girl by the wicker window.
There was a suggestion of timidness in
her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Monague, the chief stewardess?&rdquo; The
girl at the small window arched her brow.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s frightfully busy. But I&mdash;&rdquo; She hesitated,
took one more look at Florence&rsquo;s face,
found it clean, frank and fair as a dew-drenched
hillside on a summer morning, wondered
in a vague sort of way how anyone could
keep herself looking like that, then said, &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
call her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned to a telephone. A moment later
she said to Florence, &ldquo;Miss Monague will talk
to you. Go right up those stairs. It&rsquo;s the last
office to the right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the girl beside her this one whispered,
&ldquo;Bet she&rsquo;s going to apply as a stewardess of
the air! Can you e-ee-magine!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; she added after a moment&rsquo;s
silence, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry they won&rsquo;t let her. She&mdash;she&rsquo;s
a swell one I bet! Regular pal like you
dream about sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the meantime Florence had made her
way blithely up the stairs. &ldquo;Chief stewardess,&rdquo;
she was thinking, &ldquo;probably forty, wears horn-rim
glasses, sits up straight, stares at you and
says, &lsquo;Age please?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was due for a shock. The chief stewardess
was not forty, nor yet twenty-five. A
slim slip of a girl, she looked in her large mahogany
chair not more than twenty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I want to see Miss Monague,&rdquo; said
Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Miss Monague.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You? Why I&mdash;&rdquo; Florence broke off, staring.</p>
<p>The other girl smiled. &ldquo;There have been
stewardesses of the air for only about five
years,&rdquo; Miss Monague explained quietly. &ldquo;We
were all young when we started. Naturally
you can&rsquo;t grow gray hair and get your spine
stiff with old age in five years. So&mdash;&rdquo; she
smiled a very friendly smile. &ldquo;So&mdash;o here I
am. What can I do for you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;why you see&mdash;&rdquo; Florence began, &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;d
like to be a stewardess. I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been a
playground director.&rdquo; She went on eagerly,
&ldquo;That really calls for pretty much the same
thing. You try to make people comfortable
and happy&mdash;show them a good time. That&rsquo;s
what a stewardess does, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I suppose so. But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; Florence broke in, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s just
about what I&rsquo;ve done. Sometimes I taught
them to do things, when they didn&rsquo;t know how&mdash;trapeze,
swinging rings and all that. But
mostly I just stayed around and saw that
everyone was busy and happy. Truly, I did
love it. But I&rsquo;ve been away. And now there
are no openings. I just thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; The little chief of the stewardesses
favored the big girl with one of her rarest
smiles. She too liked this girl. She wished
to help, but&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m truly sorry!&rdquo; A little up-and-down line
appeared between her eyes. &ldquo;The trouble is,
I don&rsquo;t think you could ever reduce that much.
Besides, you&rsquo;re too tall.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Reduce!&rdquo; Florence exclaimed. &ldquo;Of course
I couldn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m hard as a rock. I put in four
hours in the tank or the gym every day when
I can. Why should I want to reduce?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because&mdash;&rdquo; a strange little smile played
around the chief stewardess&rsquo; mouth. &ldquo;Because
our airplane cabins are just so big and we have
to get girls that fit the cabins,&mdash;five feet four
inches, a hundred and twenty pounds; those
are the limits. Can be smaller, but never
larger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Florence stared for a moment, then
burst out in good-natured laughter. &ldquo;I&mdash;I
guess I won&rsquo;t do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was gone before the truly kind-hearted
stewardess could tell her how sorry she was.</p>
<p>Florence was still smiling when she left the
building. But the smile did not last. It is always
hard, for even the strongest hearted to
be in a great city alone and with no one near
who will say, &ldquo;You may help me do this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She walked slowly and quite soberly over
the cinder path that led to the airport depot.
Arrived there, she walked in and looked about
her. There was something about the place
that stirred her strangely. &ldquo;Such movement!
Such a wonderful feeling of abundant life!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>She walked through the door that led to the
landing field. Once outside, she stood spellbound.
A giant silver plane, looking more like
a huge sea bird than any man-made thing,
came gliding down the runway to wheel
gracefully about and into position. From
somewhere came the barking notes of an announcer:
&ldquo;Plane No. 43 eastbound for Toledo,
Buffalo and New York, now loading.&rdquo; She
saw the smiling passengers following redcaps
to the plane as they might have to a train,
caught the signal, watched the plane roll
away, heard the thunder of its motors, then
saw it rise slowly in air and speed away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&mdash;&rdquo; her voice caught. Experienced as
she was in the ways of the world, a tear glistened
in her eye as she murmured hoarsely,
&ldquo;That is what I wanted to become a part of.
And they won&rsquo;t let me be&mdash;because I&rsquo;m too
big.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned about to hide that tear. Next
instant she was staring fascinated at three tiny
objects lying close to the wall, three tiny
sticks, two parallel and one crossing them at
a sharp angle. &ldquo;Jeanne! Petite Jeanne!&rdquo; she
all but cried aloud. &ldquo;Jeanne has been here, not
long ago either. That is her gypsy <i>patteran</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; In her excitement she grasped
the arm of an attendant. &ldquo;Was there a slim
blonde-haired girl here a little while ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty of them,&rdquo; the attendant grinned
good-naturedly, &ldquo;mebby twenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but one you would not forget. One who
dresses in bright clothes like a gypsy. Perhaps
there was a gypsy woman with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you mean that gypsy pilot!&rdquo; The attendant
began to show a real interest. &ldquo;Yes,
she was here. She went away with Rosemary
Sample and a couple of men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&mdash;who&rsquo;s Rosemary Sample?&rdquo; Florence
could scarcely speak for excitement.
Jeanne! She had found her good pal Jeanne&mdash;that
is, almost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rosemary Sample is a stewardess,&rdquo; the attendant
explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wh&mdash;where did they go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t&mdash;yes, come to think of it, I heard
Rosemary say they was goin&rsquo; to Little Sweden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little Sweden? Where&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How should I know?&rdquo; the man drawled.
&ldquo;You might ask in Norway. That&rsquo;s close to
Sweden, ain&rsquo;t it?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; His voice rose suddenly. &ldquo;Coming!&rdquo;
He hurried away, leaving Florence hanging
between the heights of heaven and the depths
of despair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER IX</span>
<br />LITTLE SWEDEN</h2>
<p>Little Sweden, strange to say, is not in
Europe, but on the near-north side in
Chicago. It is a place to eat, a unique and interesting
place. There buxom maidens in
white aprons and quaint starched caps do your
bidding. It is a place of marvelous abundance.
You do not order food. It is there before you
on a long table. You pay for a meal, then help
yourself. On the long board tables are great
circles of chopped meat&mdash;beef, veal and chicken
cooked in the most delicious manner. Salads,
also done in circles, and luscious fruits, strange
cakes and curious loaves of brown bread. It is
as if all that is best in Sweden had been carried
across the sea and reassembled for you and
for your guests.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>Our four friends, Rosemary, Jeanne, Danby
and Willie had been whisked away from the
airport to this remarkable place. A half hour
after Florence had asked the question, &ldquo;Where
is Little Sweden?&rdquo; they might have been
found shut away in a small private dining
room of the place, holding a conference over
cakes and coffee.</p>
<p>Rosemary was on a forty-eight hour rest
period. This is a regular thing for all stewardesses
when they arrive at their home port.
During the past twelve hours Rosemary had
seen much of Petite Jeanne, and she had found
her to be a very charming person. Simple in
her tastes, modest, kindly, ever ready to serve
others, Jeanne was, she thought, altogether
lovely. During that twelve hours Danby Force
had kept the wires hot in a vain search for
some clue that might lead him to the dark-faced
woman who had so mysteriously vanished.</p>
<p>Willie VanGeldt had been admitted to the
conference because, as Rosemary had discovered,
beneath his apparently happy-go-lucky
and altogether haphazard nature there was a
foundation of pure gold. He liked folks and
was ready to help them, to &ldquo;go the limit,&rdquo; as
he expressed it, if only they would tell him
what might be done. He had been quite
entranced with the company of the little stewardess
and was more than ready to aid her
friends.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>&ldquo;First of all,&rdquo; Rosemary was saying, &ldquo;I
want you all to keep in touch with me as far
as that is possible. I have a radio in my room.
You have radios on your airplanes. We will
see that they are in tune. When I am here I&rsquo;ll
be in my room from eight to eleven in the
evening. Should you have anything to report
or be in need, call the numbers 48&mdash;48, give
your location if you can, then deliver your
message. I&rsquo;ll not be able to reply by radio, but
I&rsquo;ll help in any way I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll take you round the world in my
plane if need be,&rdquo; said Willie.</p>
<p>To this he received a strange reply from the
little stewardess: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not take me off the
ground, no matter what happens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? Why won&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; He stared in unbelief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll answer that later.&rdquo; She cast him a half
apologetic look. &ldquo;Mr. Force has something to
show us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said Danby Force, &ldquo;is a picture of
the lady who threatens to ruin our happy community.&rdquo;
He held the photograph before them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She appears to prefer air travel, and she
will travel again,&rdquo; said Rosemary. &ldquo;We have
a hundred and fifty stewardesses in the air.
Why not have a picture made for each of
these? If they all keep watch, we may find
her quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grand idea!&rdquo; Danby exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have
them made at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be wandering about, as gypsy people
have a way of doing,&rdquo; Jeanne said with a fine
smile. &ldquo;If I catch sight of that dark lady, I&rsquo;ll
whisper 48&mdash;48 into my receiver and things will
be doing at once.&rdquo; Little did Jeanne dream of
the strange circumstances under which that
mystic signal 48&mdash;48 would slip from her lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But tell us&mdash;&rdquo; Jeanne leaned forward
eagerly. &ldquo;Tell us of these so terrible spies.
Shall they be shot at sunrise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Danby Force smiled. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t
shoot industrial spies. In fact I&rsquo;m afraid it
would be difficult to so much as get them put
in prison. An idea, however valuable, is not
easy to get hold of and prove. You may steal
it, yet no one in the world can prove that you
have it. That sounds rather strange, doesn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo; He laughed a jolly laugh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And by the way!&rdquo; he exclaimed suddenly.
&ldquo;Just this morning I received a message that
proves we still have spies in our plant. A scrap
of note-paper with plans drawn on it, picked
up off the floor of the mill, proves that. And
this,&rdquo; he added rather strangely, &ldquo;gives me
fresh hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope! Hope! Hope!&rdquo; the others cried in
chorus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; said Danby, &ldquo;if they are still
with us, then they have not yet secured all the
secrets needed for their selfish and cowardly
plans. You see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke short off. There came a movement
at the draperies of the door. A head was thrust
in. A smiling face looked down upon them. A
pair of lips said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeanne, I have found you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten seconds later Jeanne was in someone&rsquo;s
arms. It was her good pal Florence. They were
together once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said Jeanne, turning a smiling face
to her friends at the table, &ldquo;is Florence Huyler,
the best girl friend I have ever known. And,&rdquo;
she added, eagerly nodding at Danby Force,
&ldquo;she&rsquo;s a fine solver of mysteries as well.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Danby&rsquo;s eyes gleamed. &ldquo;Come and
join us, Miss Huyler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be back very soon.&rdquo; Jeanne popped
out of the little dining room to reappear in an
incredibly short time with a heaping plate of
food.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;is Little Sweden,
the place where everyone eats all he can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Danby, nodding to Jeanne,
&ldquo;tell me about your friend. Why do you think
she is a solver of mysteries?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; Jeanne replied, &ldquo;she has solved
many.&rdquo; At once she launched into a recital of
her friend&rsquo;s many achievements. She spoke
of the mysterious &ldquo;Crimson Thread,&rdquo; of the
&ldquo;Thirteenth Ring,&rdquo; of the &ldquo;Lady Cop and the
Three Rubies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am delighted,&rdquo; said Danby Force. &ldquo;But
then&mdash;&rdquo; his voice dropped, &ldquo;no doubt you are
permanently employed and cannot join us in
our search for this dark lady and her companion
spies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; Florence smiled a doubtful
smile, &ldquo;I am very much unemployed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How fortunate!&rdquo; Danby extended his
hand. &ldquo;And you are a social worker of a sort,
a recreation lady. I have been promising myself
for a long time that we should have a
social secretary at our plant. I shall appoint
you at once and you shall have a double duty&mdash;to
serve our simple, kindly people, and to
search for a spy. What do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can I say but yes!&rdquo; The large girl
beamed. &ldquo;What a day!&rdquo; she was thinking to
herself. &ldquo;I go blundering into a place looking
for a job that&rsquo;s several sizes too small for me.
And now I fall upon one that is just exactly
my kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life,&rdquo; she said aloud, &ldquo;is beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Danby Force agreed, &ldquo;life is beautiful
at times, and should always be so. When
we are selfish or unkind we mar the beauty of
life for someone. When we are suspicious or
unjust, when we lay heavy burdens on the
weak, we are destroying life&rsquo;s beauty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he repeated slowly, &ldquo;life must be
beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; Rosemary Sample held up a hand.
&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A horn,&rdquo; said Jeanne. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s another
and another. This, why this!&rdquo; She sprang to
her feet. &ldquo;This is the night of Hallowe&rsquo;en!
And this is the last night of the Great Fair,
that most beautiful Century of Progress. Florence,&rdquo;
she cried, &ldquo;do you not remember the
&lsquo;Hour of Enchantment&rsquo;? We must go there
tonight. We truly must!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall all go,&rdquo; said Danby Force. &ldquo;It
will prove a never-to-be-forgotten night, I feel
sure.&rdquo; He spoke the truth, but he did not even
so much as dream the half of it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER X</span>
<br />ONE WILD NIGHT</h2>
<p>A half hour later the little company had
joined the merry mad throng that, combining
the enthusiasm of Hallowe&rsquo;en with a
farewell to a beloved play spot, was making
the most of one wild night.</p>
<p>Never had any of them seen anything quite
so tremendous, for Chicago, like some young
giant, has never learned how big it really is.
When a crowd of three hundred thousand persons
descends upon one narrow park, things
are sure to happen. And even now they were
happening fast.</p>
<p>Already the &ldquo;Battle of Paris&rdquo; was on. In
the Streets of Paris someone had thrown a
bottle through a mirror. At once a hundred
bottles were dying, a hundred windows crashing.
With wild abandon the throng surged
back and forth along the narrow streets.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>All this was quite unknown to our friends.
They had not come to revel but to bid a fond
farewell to a spot they had learned to love.
The Sky Ride, the shimmering waters of the
lagoon, Hollywood, Rutledge Tavern&mdash;a hundred
little corners had played a part in the
lives of Florence and Jeanne.</p>
<p>For all this, the spirit of the mob gripped
them and, grasping one another by the shoulders
that they might not be separated, they
surged on through the crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One wild night!&rdquo; Florence screamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s not yet begun!&rdquo; Willie, who was
in the lead, called back.</p>
<p>The Streets of Paris was not the only spot
where revelers, getting out of bounds, were
rushing shops and collecting souvenirs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come down from there!&rdquo; shouted a policeman
as a large fat man climbed to the top of
a shop-keeper&rsquo;s shelves for some treasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come and get me!&rdquo; The fat man brandished
a cane. The crowd roared applause.</p>
<p>Three burly policemen marched upon him.
One seized his cane, the others caught him by
his massive legs, and down he came. Once
again the crowd roared. On this night of
nights, one moment you were a hero and the
next you were forgotten.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>Like great armies of rats, this human throng
burrowed in everywhere. A barrel of rootbeer
was turned half over, glasses seized and a toast
drunk to the departing Fair. When the barrel
was drained a long, lank individual sat astride
it. Three men gave the barrel a push. Barrel
and man went rolling and bouncing down a
steep incline and on into the lagoon.</p>
<p>They were crossing the lagoon bridge, Willie,
Danby, Florence, Rosemary and Jeanne,
when of a sudden Danby Force exclaimed in
a hoarse whisper, &ldquo;There! There she is! The
dark lady, the spy! See that split ear? I&rsquo;d
know her anywhere by that. There can be no
doubt of it. Her ears have evidently been
pierced for ear-rings, and one of the rings at
some time must have been torn through the
flesh, leaving a disfigurement. Yes, that&rsquo;s the
spy, I&rsquo;m sure of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The spy! The spy!&rdquo; came from the others.
Could a moment more thrilling and more
impossible be imagined? Here they were not
twenty feet from the one they sought. And
that twenty feet packed tight with writhing,
twisting, screaming revelers of Hallowe&rsquo;en,
the end of the Fair!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>Then, as if to redouble the suspense, someone
threw a great switch. As if by magic, the
entire grounds went dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Oh! Oh!&rdquo; came the murmurs of surprise,
thrill and horror, from the streets many
miles long, all packed with humanity.</p>
<p>The effect was strange. In a crowd of many
thousands each individual feels very much
alone. Florence felt Rosemary&rsquo;s grip tighten
on her shoulder as she, in turn, clutched at
Willie&rsquo;s coat. Danby Force alone did not lose
his poise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lose her,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;This is
midnight. The lights will be on again soon.
Then we must get her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was not mistaken. Like the sudden dawn
of a tropical day, the lights flashed on. The
Sky Ride towers turned to tall stems of light.
Masses of red, orange and green shone on
every side. From the loud-speaker came the
notes of a bugle, the high clear notes of
&ldquo;Taps.&rdquo; For the moment, so great was the
feeling that came welling up from the very
center of her being, Florence forgot the spy.
Then, with lips that quivered, she whispered
to Willie:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! There! Just ahead! I&rsquo;ll get her.&rdquo;
Willie lunged forward.</p>
<p>But the crowd still surged about them. He
moved slowly. And the dark lady, apparently
unconscious of the fate that lurked so near,
also moved on with the throng.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pass the word back,&rdquo; Willie whispered.
&ldquo;Tell them to get a good grip on the fellow&rsquo;s
shoulders just ahead and then shove. Flying
wedge. See?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence passed the word back. Next instant,
urged on by a great push from behind,
she sent her solid one hundred and sixty
pounds against Willie&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>It worked. They moved forward. A foot,
two feet, three, four, five, ten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get her!&rdquo; Willie hissed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She might have heard. Perhaps she did.
She turned half about. No matter now, for,
just as Willie&rsquo;s outstretched hand all but
touched her, a second flying wedge composed
of college boys struck their line at the very
center. The result was rout and confusion.
Like beads when the string is broken, our
friends were scattered far and wide.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>And where was the lady spy?</p>
<p>For a space of time, no one knew. Then
Willie spotted her, farther away and moving
rapidly.</p>
<p>After that things happened so fast that
even to Florence&rsquo;s keen mind they remain a
blur. Willie sprang forward. A cleared space
just before him was closed as if by magic.
Four policemen and a score of revelers closed
it. There came the sound of thwacking clubs.
Willie tripped and fell. He was up on the instant,
but minus his hat. No matter. Someone
jammed a hat on his head. Whose hat? He
did not know or care. But for the instant after
that he cared a lot. It was a policeman&rsquo;s hat.
He wore a dark blue suit. In the crush he was
mistaken for an officer.</p>
<p>He had just sighted the dark lady once more
when three strong men seized him, lifted him
on high, lunged forward, then tipped him
neatly over the rail. As he shot down, down,
down to the icy waters of the lagoon, the
crowd let out a roar of approval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crowds,&rdquo; he grumbled as he swam for the
shore, &ldquo;psychological mobs never have any
sense of humor.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>When he had clambered to the embankment,
he turned to see his four friends waving at
him from the bridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodbye folks!&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
home for my dress suit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, realizing they could not hear, he
grasped his damp coat tail, gave it a wringing
twist, threw up his hands, pointed to the spot
where city lights gleamed, and marched away.
&ldquo;Forty above!&rdquo; he was grumbling again. &ldquo;No
night for a plunge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then as his mood changed, he began to sing,
&ldquo;Goodbye Fair! Goodbye Paree! Goodbye
boys! Goodbye girls! Goodbye everybody!
I&rsquo;m going home to my Mom-ee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As for the lady spy, she had lost herself for
good and all. In a crowd of three hundred
thousand you might hope to meet anyone once,
but never twice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER XI</span>
<br />GOODBYE FAIR</h2>
<p>Rosemary, Florence, Jeanne and Danby
did not leave the Fair grounds at once.
Indeed they could not because of the crush.
They did turn their faces toward the exit.</p>
<p>As they pressed their way out of the dense
throngs to a spot where there was at least
space for breathing, their eyes were greeted by
strange sights.</p>
<p>Off to the right a group of thoughtless revelers
were tearing up a hedge. Some were carrying
away the shrubs as souvenirs, others
were using them as mock-weapons for beating
one another over the back.</p>
<p>From a village where imitation towers
reared themselves to the sky came cries of
laughter and screams of distress. Presently a
throng broke through the flimsy walls and
came pouring out. They had gone too far in
their vandalism. The firemen had thrown a
cooling stream of water on their heated brows.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll have time enough to cool off now,&rdquo;
Danby Force laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how sad to think that those who so
often have come to this place to find beauty
and happiness should, on this last night, remain
to destroy!&rdquo; There was a look of distress
on the little French girl&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; said Danby Force, &ldquo;There are some
things we must try to forget. This is one of
them. Let us always think of the great Fair
as it was in the height of its glory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they moved on toward the Aisle of
Flags, they came to a spot that, like an eddy
in a stream, even on this night of turmoil was
at rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodbye.&rdquo; A boy was clasping a girl&rsquo;s
hand. &ldquo;Goodbye Mary. See you at the next
Fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanne knew these two a little. They had
worked side by side selling orangeade and ice
cream cones. Now it was &ldquo;Goodbye until the
next Fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when that comes,&rdquo; she murmured,
&ldquo;their hair will be gray. Goodbye until the
next Fair.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>As they passed an apparently deserted hot-dog
stand, Jeanne caught sight of a figure
crumpled up in a dark corner. A young girl,
perhaps not yet eighteen, she sat with head on
arms, silently sobbing.</p>
<p>Jeanne was gypsy enough to read that girl&rsquo;s
fortune. All through the bright summer days
and on into the glorious autumn, the great
Fair had offered her means of making a living.
Perhaps she was helping to support her
parents. Who could tell? Now it was all over&mdash;the
last hot-dog sold. &ldquo;Goodbye Fair,&rdquo;
Jeanne whispered, swallowing hard.</p>
<p>Stepping silently back, she slipped a bit of
green paper into the girl&rsquo;s hand, then disappeared
too quickly to be seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life must be beautiful,&rdquo; she said to Danby
Force, &ldquo;but how can it be, for all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be increasingly beautiful for all.&rdquo;
The young man&rsquo;s face set in hard lines of determination.</p>
<p>Jeanne thought of the work he had done for
his own little city, thought too of those industrial
spies who threatened to destroy it all.
&ldquo;I must help,&rdquo; she told herself almost fiercely.
&ldquo;I must do all I can. Life,&rdquo; she whispered
reverently, &ldquo;Life <i>must</i> be beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>As for Florence, her mind all this while was
so full of the morrow that she had little
thought for the passing hour. &ldquo;Tomorrow,&rdquo;
she was saying to herself, &ldquo;I shall be speeding
through the air with Danby Force on my way
to a new field and fresh adventure. I am to
help the children, yes, and the grownups, of
a small city&mdash;to enjoy life. At the same time
I am to search for a spy.&rdquo; She wondered in a
vague sort of way what that search would be
like and how successful she would be as a lady
detective. She was wondering still when Danby
Force said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time for a hot drink before the clock
strikes one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Oh yes!&rdquo; Jeanne&rsquo;s voice rose in sudden
eagerness. &ldquo;I know the very place. It is
run by some English gypsies. At this time of
night only gypsies will be found there. But,
ah my friend, such good tea as they brew!
You never could know until you have sipped
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, a gypsy&rsquo;s den at one in the morning!
Show us the way.&rdquo; And Danby hailed a taxi.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>Ten minutes later they were entering a long,
low basement room such as only Jeanne had
seen before. It was finished as the inside of
the ancient gypsy vans were finished, in a
score of bright colors, red, yellow, orange,
blue, silver and gold. There were few lights.
Some were like ancient lanterns, and some
were mere glimmering tapers. Trophies of
the hunt hung against the walls&mdash;the head of
a deer, the grinning skeleton of a wild boar&rsquo;s
head.</p>
<p>There were no chairs. Instead all sat, true
gypsy fashion, on rugs. Strange rugs they
were too, woven of some heavy material and
all brightly colored.</p>
<p>In one corner a group of dark foreign looking
people in bright costumes sat smoking
long-stemmed pipes and sipping tea. A cloud
of smoke, hanging close to the ceiling, created
the illusion of low-hanging clouds and the out-of-doors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfect!&rdquo; Danby murmured.</p>
<p>At sound of his voice, a solidly built woman,
wrapped in a bright shawl, turned to look
up at him. In her eyes was a dreamy look.
Before her on the floor were cards. On the
cards were pictures&mdash;a snake, a house, a fountain,
a lion, a mouse, a burning fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Madame Bihari!&rdquo; Florence exclaimed, delighted.
&ldquo;And you have the gypsy witch cards.
You shall tell my fortune, for tomorrow I am
to begin a splendid new adventure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall find beauty and happiness.&rdquo;
Madame smiled a glad smile. She did not look
at the cards. &ldquo;You have learned a great secret.
Health, strength, sunshine, the wide out-of-doors&mdash;they
are your great joy. With these
alone anyone may find happiness. You are a
true gypsy at heart, my splendid Florence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you. That is kind.&rdquo; Florence favored
her with a rare smile. &ldquo;But Madame,
please, my fortune! You have never told it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no need,&rdquo; the gypsy woman murmured.
&ldquo;It is written in your face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But sit you all down upon my rug. Order
me a good cup of black tea and you shall have
as good a fortune as I can bring you. But beware,
child! You have insisted. If the cards
turn up wrong, do not blame your poor old
Madame Bihari. It is you who shall shuffle, cut
and deal&mdash;not I.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>When tea had been brought on a silver tray,
Florence shuffled the cards, cut them with her
left hand, then placed them one by one in their
proper positions. Then Madame, bending forward,
began to study them. The four friends,
forgetting their tea, sat upon their feet, waiting
in eager expectation. Moving in from their
corner, the gypsies too watched in silence.</p>
<p>Over one who has seen them often an indescribable
spell is cast by the gypsy witch cards.
The serpent striking at some unseen object;
the eye, gleaming at you from the half darkness;
the fire leaping from the hearth; the
mouse; the clasped hands; the lightning&mdash;all
these and many others appear to take on a special
meaning. And so they do in very truth to
the teller of fortunes.</p>
<p>When at last Madame began to speak, an
audible sigh rose from the little group of
watchers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have friends.&rdquo; Her voice was low and
even as the murmur of a slow moving stream.
&ldquo;Many friends. It is well, for there shall be
perils. There is one you may wish to trust,
even to love a little; but you must not, for that
one is a traitor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The spy!&rdquo; Jeanne whispered in her companion&rsquo;s
ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The spy!&rdquo; Florence shuddered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You shall serve and shall be served,&rdquo; Madame
went on. &ldquo;You shall travel&mdash;high in air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow,&rdquo; Danby laughed a low laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are entering upon a fresh adventure.
Will you succeed?&rdquo; Madame stared long at the
cards. &ldquo;It is not written here. The cards are
silent. Perhaps another time.&rdquo; She looked up
with a slow smile on her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, Jeannie, my little one, my tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A long sighing breath from every pair of
lips, a light nervous laugh, then the spell was
broken. Florence knew her fortune. They
might all drink their tea, then scatter to their
homes for a short night of repose. To Florence,
at least, the coming day would bring new
scenes and fresh promise of adventure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CHAPTER XII</span>
<br />FLYING THROUGH THE NIGHT</h2>
<p>Just twenty-four hours after she had stood
disconsolate before the airport depot,
watching giant man-made birds sail away into
the blue sky, Florence stood, traveling bag in
hand, all radiant, waiting for her silver ship to
wheel into position for flight. Beside her stood
Danby Force and the little French girl. Danby
too was going. It was to be a night flight. &ldquo;All
the more thrilling!&rdquo; had been Jeanne&rsquo;s instant
prediction. &ldquo;Flying by night! Seeming to play
among the stars! Ah, what could be more delightful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosemary Sample, whose plane did not go
out until the following morning, was there to
see them off. So too, quite dried out from the
previous night&rsquo;s adventure, was Willie VanGeldt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>Florence found herself thrilled to the very
tips of her toes. As a blue and gold plane with
three motors thundering glided away, then
with a roar of thunder rose in air, as a small
yellow one followed it into the sky, she counted
the moments that remained before the number
of her own plane should be called and she,
walking with all the care-free indifference of
the much air-traveled lady (which she was not
at all), should march to the three iron steps
leading to the plane and climb on board.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may think it strange,&rdquo; Danby was saying
to Jeanne, &ldquo;that we should go to so much
trouble to catch one industrial spy, and a lady
at that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But no!&rdquo; Jeanne exclaimed. &ldquo;Lady spies,
they are the most clever and most difficult of
all. The great and terrible war proved that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Danby agreed. &ldquo;And in this peace-time
war of industry, when great secrets are
being guarded, secrets that might win or lose
another great war&mdash;which, please God, there
may never be&mdash;the ladies bear watching, I assure
you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there <i>are</i> secrets,&mdash;&rdquo; his tone became
animated. &ldquo;Chemical secrets that have made
work for thousands, secret processes for heat-treating
steel that have revolutionized an entire
industry.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And secrets that give us better and more
beautiful dresses. Ah!&rdquo; Jeanne laughed a
merry laugh. &ldquo;This is the most wonderful secret
of all. For where there is color there is
beauty. Beauty brings happiness. Life must be
beautiful. So&mdash;o, my good friend&mdash;&rdquo; She put
forth a slender hand&mdash;&ldquo;I wish you luck! May
you and my good friend Florence catch those
so very wicked spies and may they be shot at
sunrise!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; her tone changed, &ldquo;I must say
adieu, for see! There is your silver ship wheeling
into position. Do not be surprised if some
day you see my own little dragon fly coming
to light on the top of your flag pole or the landing
field nearby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, Florence!&rdquo; She gave her good
pal a merry poke. &ldquo;Shoulders up, eyes smiling,
the good and jaunty air. Tell the world that
this is nothing new. And <i>bon voyage</i> to you
both. I shall be seeing you. And I shall be
watching, always watching for that dark lady,
the most terrible spy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>Smiling, Florence touched her lips to
Jeanne&rsquo;s fair brow, then putting on her very
best air of indifference, which was very good
indeed, marched to her plane, climbed the
steps, then sank into a soft low seat to let forth
a sigh that was half relief and half deep abiding
joy.</p>
<p>Having seen them off, Jeanne went in search
of her flying gypsies. They had planned to
join in a reunion of their tribe a hundred miles
away. Jeanne was to fly them there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Willie VanGeldt when he and
Rosemary were alone, &ldquo;You said last night you
would not fly with me. Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because&mdash;&rdquo; an intent look overspread Rosemary&rsquo;s
usually smiling face. &ldquo;Because you are
grown up, and yet you insist on playing about,
on making life a joke and because flying with
you is not safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not safe!&rdquo; He stared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a pilot&rsquo;s license.
Didn&rsquo;t get it with a pull either. Earned it, I
did.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not questioning that,&rdquo; she went on soberly.
&ldquo;All the same, it&rsquo;s flyers like you who
are spoiling this whole aviation business. Look
at me&mdash;I&rsquo;m a worker. Being a flying stewardess
is my job. I work at it every month in the
year. The pilots and their helpers, the mechanics
in our shops, the radio men on duty all day,
every day, depend on it for their living and the
support of their families. Together we hope to
make our transportation safe, comfortable and
inexpensive for all. We&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! Let me finish,&rdquo; she insisted. &ldquo;Look at
our planes. Sixty of them, cost seventy thousand
dollars apiece. Multiply that and see what
it comes to. Shows that men with money believe
in us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See how those planes are cared for. Looked
over in every port. Least thing wrong, out
they go. Motors taken off and overhauled every
three hundred hours. Always in perfect
condition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&mdash;&rdquo; there was a rising inflection in
her voice. &ldquo;You go round the world proclaiming
to all the world that life is a joke and that
airplanes are grand, good playthings. You
flirt with death. And in the end death will get
you. Then thousands will say, &lsquo;See! Flying
is <i>not</i> safe!&rsquo; See what I mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you what!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a safe
guess you don&rsquo;t even know when your motor
was last overhauled and cleaned.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&mdash;&rdquo; the play-boy was not smiling now.
&ldquo;Well now, Miss Sample, you see this crack-up
has cost a lot of money. So I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you ask me to risk my life flying with
you. And I say &lsquo;No!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll have to be going.&rdquo; Her tone
changed. &ldquo;Got a report to make out. I&rsquo;ll be
seeing you. And I only hope it won&rsquo;t be under
a high bank of cut flowers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was gone, leaving Willie staring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer sort of girl!&rdquo; he grumbled after a
time. &ldquo;But I&mdash;she sure is a good one!</p>
<p>&ldquo;She might be right at that,&rdquo; he murmured
as he left the building.</p>
<p>For Florence, speeding away through space
with the stars above and the earth below, that
was a never-to-be-forgotten night. First the
broad expanse of the city&rsquo;s gleaming lights and
after that, in sharp contrast, deep, sullen blue
below that suggested eternity of space.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re over the lake,&rdquo; Danby Force smiled.
&ldquo;Way over there is the light of a ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And still farther there is another,&rdquo; Florence
replied. &ldquo;How rapidly we leave those
lights behind! How strange to be speeding
along through the night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>Soon the deep blue below changed to varying
shadows. They were over land once more.
The panorama that passed beneath them never
lost its charm. Here, faintly glowing, were the
lights of a tiny village. Were they asleep, those
people? Probably not. Too early for that.
Some were reading, some studying, some playing
games, those simple kindly people who live
in small villages.</p>
<p>The village vanished and only a single light,
here and there, like reflections of the stars, told
where farm houses stood. A city loomed into
sight, then passed on into the unknown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like life,&rdquo; Florence said soberly. &ldquo;We
are always passing from one unknown to another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And speaking of unknowns&mdash;&rdquo; her voice
changed. &ldquo;Do you think the industrial spy who
is still in your employ is a man or a woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have no means of knowing.&rdquo; Danby
spoke soberly. &ldquo;To find this out if you can,
this is to be part of your task.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I can,&rdquo; Florence whispered to herself,
after a time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>So they rode on through the night. Danby
Force seldom spoke. This riding in an airplane
appeared to cast a spell of silence over him.
Perhaps, at times, he slept. Florence could not
tell. She did not sleep. The experience was
too novel for that. Twice she caught the gleam
of colored lights and knew they were meeting
another plane. She tried to imagine what it
would be like when everyone traveled by air.
But would that time come? Who could tell?</p>
<p>It was still dark when Danby Force, after
looking at his watch, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be there in ten minutes. You shall go
to my house for ten winks of sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>True to his prediction, the plane went roaring
down to a small landing field. They disembarked,
were met by a small man in a green
uniform and were led to a powerful car. Having
taken their places in the back seat, they
were whirled away to at last mount a hill by a
winding road and stop before a tall gray stone
house surrounded by very tall trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother and I live here,&rdquo; Danby said.
&ldquo;I should prefer greater simplicity, but a beautiful
old lady you call &lsquo;mother&rsquo; must always be
humored.&rdquo; Florence could have loved him for
that speech.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>She understood more clearly what he meant
when, once inside the wide reception room,
they were met by a butler and a white-capped
maid whisked her away to a spacious bedroom
all fitted up with massive furniture.</p>
<p>Sleep came at once. Before she realized it a
rosy dawn ushered in another day. &ldquo;What shall
this day bring forth?&rdquo; she murmured as, with a
chill and a thrill, she leaped from her bed to
do a dozen setting-up exercises, and at last to
dress herself in her most business-like costume.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mademoiselle the detective,&rdquo; she laughed
as she looked in the mirror. &ldquo;I surely don&rsquo;t
look the part.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIII</span>
<br />SUSPECTS</h2>
<p>The small city&mdash;scarcely more than a large
village&mdash;that Florence found herself entering
that morning was, at this season of the
year, a place of enchanting beauty. Half hidden
by the New England hills, its white homes
surrounded by trees and shrubs turned by the
hand of a master artist, Nature, into things of
flaming red and gold, it seemed the setting for
some marvelous production in drama or opera.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;it seems so unreal,&rdquo; she whispered to
herself. &ldquo;The hillside all red, orange and gold,
the houses so clean and white. Even the women
and children in their bright dresses seem automatic
things run by springs and strings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finding herself half-way up a hill, on one
side of which a whole procession of very small
houses, all just alike, appeared to be struggling,
she paused to stare at a sign which read:
&ldquo;Room for rent.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How could they rent a room?&rdquo; she asked
herself. &ldquo;The house is little more than a bird&rsquo;s
nest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Consumed by curiosity, she climbed the narrow
steps and knocked at the door.</p>
<p>A small lady with prematurely gray hair appeared.
&ldquo;I came to ask about the room,&rdquo; Florence
said in as steady a tone as she could command.</p>
<p>Next instant she found herself in a house
that made her feel very large. The hall was
narrow, the doors low, the rooms tiny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the room.&rdquo; She was led to what
seemed the smallest of the four rooms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this is already occupied.&rdquo; She looked
first at the display of simple toilet articles on
the dresser, then at the half-filled closet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, our daughter Verna has it now,&rdquo;
the little lady hastened to explain. &ldquo;But she&mdash;she&rsquo;s
to sleep in our&mdash;our general room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one they use for parlor, living room
and dining room,&rdquo; Florence thought to herself.
&ldquo;How terrible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was about to say politely, &ldquo;I guess I
wouldn&rsquo;t be interested,&rdquo; when a young and
slender girl of surprising beauty stepped into
the doorway.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here is Verna now,&rdquo; her mother said simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, here she is,&rdquo; some imp appeared to
whisper in Florence&rsquo;s ear, &ldquo;and you are going
to take this room. You will have to now. You
are going to buy a small bed and share the
room with this beautiful child. You will cast
your lot with this little family. You have seen
her. It is too late to turn back now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps if he had been a very wise imp he
might have added, &ldquo;This step you are taking
now will bring you into grave danger, but that
does not matter. You will take the room all
the same, and like it.&rdquo; But the imp, being of a
very ordinary sort, did not say this.</p>
<p>Florence <i>did</i> take the room. She <i>did</i> buy herself
a very narrow bed and she <i>did</i> share this
small room in this canary-cage of a house with
the beautiful girl. And, strangest of all, she
became very happy about it almost at once.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>The life into which she found herself thrown
was strange indeed. She had lived in a small
mid-western city where there was no mill or
factory. She had lived in a great city. In each
place she had found companions of her own
sort. But here she was thrown at once into a
community of small homes owned by people
whose incomes had always been small and who
looked out upon the world beyond their doors
with something akin to awe. To Florence all
this was strange.</p>
<p>Her task, that of finding the industrial spy,
she believed to be an easy one. In the privacy
of his inner office, she said to Danby Force,
&ldquo;Most of these people have lived here all their
lives. You could not make a spy of them if you
chose. All I have to do is to find out the ones
who have been here a short time. It must be
one of these.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are probably right,&rdquo; the young man
agreed. &ldquo;Not so many of them either, perhaps
a dozen. I shall see that you have their names
tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the morrow she had the names. And,
after that, one by one, in the most casual manner
she looked them up. There were, she found,
two middle-aged, dark-complexioned sisters
named Dvorac, expert weavers who lived in a
mere shack at the back of the city. Miriam,
the taller of the two, appeared to be the leader.
&ldquo;Might be these,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;They resemble
the one who escaped.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>There was a little weasel-faced German who
excited her suspicion at once. He was an expert
electrician of a very special sort. He was in
charge of the hundreds of motors that ran the
looms and spinning machines. He was, of
course, all over the place. &ldquo;Finest chance in
the world,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;And he appears
to be always prying about, even when nothing
seems wrong.&rdquo; This man&rsquo;s name was Hans
Schneider.</p>
<p>There was a girl too, one about her own age,
who came in for her full share of suspicion.
She worked in the dyeing room. The very first
day Florence caught her slipping out with an
ink bottle. The bottle was filled with dyeing
fluid. &ldquo;I only wanted to dye a faded dress,&rdquo;
the girl explained reluctantly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d want to
do that too if you hadn&rsquo;t had a new dress for
four years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence guessed she would. She wanted to
accompany the girl home, but did not quite
dare. So she suggested that the bottle be taken
to the floor supervisor and permission obtained
for its removal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>The girl, who called herself Ina Piccalo (a
strange combination of names) flashed Florence
a look of anger as she obeyed instructions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her eyes are black as night,&rdquo; Florence told
herself. &ldquo;She&rsquo;d look stunning in a gown of
deep purple and the dye is just that. I&rsquo;ll be
looking for that gown,&rdquo; she told herself as a
moment later, with a flash of her white teeth,
Ina passed her, the bottle still in her hand.</p>
<p>This was the only instance in which Florence
interfered in any way with the actions of
the employees of the mill. She was, to all appearances,
only a young welfare worker whose
business it was to make everyone happy, with
special interest in the children of the city.</p>
<p>This part she played very well. Long hours
were spent in the mill&rsquo;s gymnasium and social
house, and upon its playgrounds. Not a week
had passed before this stalwart, rosy-cheeked
girl was known to every child of the city, and
nearly every grown-up as well. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s her,&rdquo;
she would hear them whisper as she passed.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the Play Lady.&rdquo; Yes, she was the Play
Lady; but much more than this, she was the
Lady Cop, the detective who, she hoped, in
time was to free their happy little city from
the dark cloud that, all unknown to the greatest
number, hung over them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>Yes, this truly <i>was</i> a happy city. Florence
grew increasingly conscious of this as the days
went by. The mill she found enchanting. The
little city with its clean white homes, surrounded
by the golden glow of autumn, was indeed
a place where one might long to linger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just now,&rdquo; she said to herself, &ldquo;I feel that
I could love to live here forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This mood, like many another in her
strange, wandering life, she knew all too well,
would pass. &ldquo;And I must not allow myself to
be lulled into inaction by it all,&rdquo; she told herself.
&ldquo;There is the spy. I <i>must</i> find the spy.
Even now he may be gathering up his stolen
secrets and preparing to carry them away to
some other city, or even across the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But how was one to catch a spy? Every moment
of each day she was watching, watching,
watching. And yet, save for the rather simple
matter of Ina Piccalo&rsquo;s carrying away a bottle
of purple dye, nothing unusual had caught her
eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may fail,&rdquo; she told herself, &ldquo;fail utterly.&rdquo;
Yet she dared to hope for a turn of the wheel
of fortune&mdash;&ldquo;the lucky break&rdquo; as the smiling
Willie VanGeldt would have called it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIV</span>
<br />GYPSY TRAIL</h2>
<p>If life, for the moment, had been robbed of
its adventure for Florence, the little French
girl Petite Jeanne had not fared so badly. To
her life had come one more thrill. It happened
in a strange and quite unexpected manner.
Having left the gypsy child with friends in
Chicago, she and Madame Bihari had gone on
a true gypsy tour of the air. Their destination
was anywhere, their home the landing field
that appeared beneath them at close of day.
Never had Jeanne been so buoyantly happy as
now. And who could wonder at this?</p>
<p>One evening just at sunset they came soaring
down upon a landing field in the open
country. Many years ago some great lover of
trees had planted here a long row of hard maples.
These now formed the farthest boundary
of the landing field. The most glorious days
of autumn had arrived. Never had there been
such a gorgeous array of colors. Here red,
orange, yellow and green were blended in a
pattern of matchless beauty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>The light of the setting sun presented all this
to the little French girl in a manner that delighted
her very soul. As if attracted by some
great magnet, her little plane taxied toward
them. The planes were all but touching the
leaves when at last the ship came to a halt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; Jeanne said, all but breathless
with delight, &ldquo;this is where we stay tonight.&rdquo;
Her tone became deeply serious. &ldquo;Why do men
from Europe say America is ugly? Nowhere
in the world is there a moment more beautiful
than this!&rdquo; She took up a handful of golden
leaves, lifted them high, then sent them sailing
away into the breeze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is a little pile of wood,&rdquo; she said a moment
later. &ldquo;There is a bare spot just out from
the trees. We shall make a little fire and boil
some water for tea. We shall dream just this
once that we are back in our so beautiful
France on the Gypsy Trail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And Madame!&rdquo; she exclaimed joyously,
&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t all gypsies travel in airplanes?
How wonderful that would be! When the
frost comes biting your toes in this beautiful
northland, when the trees lose their glory and
stand all bleak and bare, then they could fold
their tents to go gliding away to the south.
One, two, three, four, five hours racing with
the wild ducks in their flight, and see! there
you are! Would it not be wonderful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite wonderful.&rdquo; Madame Bihari beamed.
Already she had the fire burning, the water on
to boil.</p>
<p>They had traveled far that day. Jeanne was
tired. Dragging out the pad to her cot, she
spread it beneath one of those ancient maples.
Stretching herself out upon it, she lay there
looking up into the labyrinth of red and gold
that hung above her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she breathed, &ldquo;if only heaven is half
as beautiful as this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; she said after a very long time,
&ldquo;why is there always trouble? Why do people
struggle so much, when all this beauty may be
had without asking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I could answer that,&rdquo; Madame said
soberly, &ldquo;I should be very wise. But this you
must remember, my Jeanne: wherever you go,
whether you succeed or fail, you will find people
ready to drag you down. Shall you let
them? Surely not, my Jeanne. We must fight,
my Jeanne.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Always?&rdquo; the little French girl asked as a
wistful note crept into her tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always, my Jeanne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a time after that they sat staring dreamily
at the fire. Then, seeming to recall half
forgotten words, Jeanne murmured softly,
&ldquo;Does the road lead uphill all the way?&rdquo; Then,
as if answering her own question, &ldquo;Yes, my
child, to the very end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trouble,&rdquo; Jeanne whispered. At once she
thought of her good pal Florence, then of
Danby Force and the problem they were trying
to solve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;do you suppose
Florence has found her spy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; Madame&rsquo;s words were
spoken slowly. &ldquo;Spies are hard to find. Some,
I am told, went all through the great war and
were not captured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should help her,&rdquo; Jeanne decided quite
suddenly. &ldquo;We shall go to that little city.
Perhaps tomorrow we shall go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment some wood sprite might
have whispered, &ldquo;No, Jeanne, not tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>With the lightning bugs flashing about them
and the song of tree toads in their ears, they
drank their tea, munched some hard crackers,
and felt that life was indeed very beautiful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall you sleep now?&rdquo; Madame asked a
half hour later. &ldquo;The tent is ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Not yet.&rdquo; Jeanne wrapped herself in
a blanket, then stretched out beneath her canopy
of gold. &ldquo;How wonderful autumn is!&rdquo;
she sighed. &ldquo;It makes you wish that life were
all like this and that one might go on living
forever. But this we cannot do, so it is best
to sing.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Dance, gypsy, dance.</p>
<p class="t">Sing, gypsy, sing,</p>
<p class="t0">Sing while you may, and forget</p>
<p class="t">That life must end.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;I should go in,&rdquo; she told herself after a
time. But she did not go. Dry leaves, rustling
in the breeze, seemed to whisper, stars, peeping
through the trees, appeared to wink at
her. The whole world seemed at peace. Even
the dog that barked from some place far away
appeared to be singing in the night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How like it is to one of those lovely nights
in France,&rdquo; she thought to herself. &ldquo;I was
only a small child. There were many gypsies,
sometimes fifty, sometimes a hundred. They
sang and they danced. Their violins! Ah yes,
how sweetly they sounded out into the night!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet&mdash;&rdquo; her mood changed. &ldquo;Would I
go back to that? Perhaps not. This is America.
This is a new day. There are exciting things
to do. There are mysteries to solve, people to
be helped. I shall solve those mysteries. I shall
help those people. I&mdash;the little French girl
they call Petite Jeanne!&rdquo; She laughed a low
laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should go in,&rdquo; she said again. She took
in three deep breaths of the pure night air, yet
she did not move. Very soon after, had one
been passing, he might have said, &ldquo;She is
asleep.&rdquo; He would have spoken the truth.</p>
<p>When she awoke some time later, a sense of
strangeness filled her mind. A spot of light in
the sky caught her eye. An exclamation
escaped her lips. &ldquo;I am still dreaming,&rdquo; she
murmured. She pinched herself hard. It hurt.
She must be wide awake, yet, up there in the
sky, gleaming as a white tower gleams when
a hundred spotlights are upon it, was a silver
ship&mdash;an airplane.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Angels!&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;They too must
have taken to the air in planes.&rdquo; This, she
knew well enough, was pure fancy. What
could this silver ship be? And what kept it
glistening like a star? That there were no
spotlights near, she knew well. And if there
were, their beams of light would stand out
against the darkness.</p>
<p>The silver ship began to circle as for a
landing. Jeanne shuddered. What if this
strange visitor of the night should land close
to her own tiny plane! She was about to spring
up and dash for the tent, when a vision of extraordinary
beauty caught her eye. The plane,
having arrived at a point directly above her
leafy bower, formed a gleaming white background
against which the red and gold of
maple leaves stood out like the colors of the
most costly tapestries.</p>
<p>So lost in her contemplation of this was the
little French girl, she did not miss the plane
when it was gone. The after-image lingered
on the picture walls of her mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is gone!&rdquo; she cried softly at last,
&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; So it was. As if swallowed up by the
night, the silver ship had vanished.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it has gone over to the depot,&rdquo; she
told herself. &ldquo;I may see that mysterious ship
in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, as if in need of companionship and
protection, she rolled up her thin mattress and
disappeared within the tent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a plane by the depot, a silver
plane!&rdquo; Jeanne exclaimed excitedly the moment
she thrust her head from the tent next
morning. &ldquo;I must see it. There was one that
glowed white all over last night. Is this the
one? I must know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since it was some distance to the depot
Jeanne, using her plane as another might an
automobile, warmed up the motor and went
taxiing over.</p>
<p>To Madame&rsquo;s vast astonishment, ten minutes
later as the silver plane went gliding over
the field to at last rise in air, Jeanne&rsquo;s dragon
fly went speeding on its trail and, in an astonishingly
short time, both planes were lost
in the blue.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">CHAPTER XV</span>
<br />LADY COP OF THE SKY</h2>
<p>But we must not forget Florence. At
Danby Force&rsquo;s request, she had arranged
for a dance in the Community House. &ldquo;Call
it a waltz night,&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;All these
older people love the old-fashioned dances and
the waltz is the best of them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she agreed, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s nothing quite
like a waltz.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She took great pleasure in arranging for
this simple social affair. She sent a bevy of
girls into the hills to gather branches of maple
and sumac. These, all afire with colors of
autumn, turned the rather drab social hall into
an elfin grotto. High in one corner she hung
a cardboard moon. Behind this was a powerful
electric lamp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the last waltz,&rdquo; she whispered to Verna
who was helping. &ldquo;We will turn off all the
other lamps and waltz by the light of the
golden moon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said the happy girl softly, &ldquo;will be
grand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their waltz night came and with it such a
crowd as the Community House had never
before known.</p>
<p>From the musicians of the community Florence
had managed to assemble an excellent
orchestra.</p>
<p>To the swinging rhythm of &ldquo;The Beautiful
Blue Danube,&rdquo; Danby Force and Florence led
the merrymakers away for the first dance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re happy,&rdquo; Danby Force said as a
pleased smile passed over his face. &ldquo;Truly,
peacefully happy. This waltz night idea is
going to be fine. We&rsquo;ll have several of them,
have them all winter long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he forgotten?&rdquo; Florence asked herself.
&ldquo;Has the spy and my mission here slipped
from his memory so soon?&rdquo; It surely seemed
so, for here he was planning her social service
work for the distant future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some day,&rdquo; she told herself with a little
shudder, &ldquo;there will be a big blow-up around
here. The spy will be found. Perhaps I shall
find him. And then there will be no more social
work done by little, big Florence.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>She resolved to forget all this and, for one
night at least, enjoy life to its full.</p>
<p>The fourth waltz had come to a close with
a glorious swing. She was seated on the side
line with Danby Force when, of a sudden, a
figure appeared on the narrow platform. A
jolly-faced young man he was. His dark eyes
were sparkling, his bushy black hair tumbled
about his ears. His was a face to charm the
world. From some woman&rsquo;s gown he had
snatched a broad belt of red cloth. A fantastic,
romantic figure he cut indeed as he stood there
waving his hands. &ldquo;Well now, that was wonderful!&rdquo;
he shouted. &ldquo;Beautiful! Artistic!
Entrancing! Marvelous!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now&mdash;&rdquo; his face became animated like
a thing glowing with inner fire. &ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s
have a little jazz.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The orchestra leader beckoned. He bent
low to listen. Then,</p>
<p>&ldquo;No music? Bah! Who wants music? It
goes like this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like a clown in the circus, he produced a
saxophone from nowhere at all, put it to his
lips and began a series of strange sounds which
everyone knew was jazz.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; He beckoned to the orchestra. His
body swayed. His eyes shone. &ldquo;Now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Who could resist him? Whether they could
or not, no one did. The orchestra followed his
lead. Dancers swarmed out upon the floor.
Soon the place was a mad house of wild, hilarious
dancing. Only Florence and Danby Force
did not dance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; Florence asked as a puzzled
frown overspread her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hugo?&rdquo; Danby Force said in a tone of surprise.
&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you met him? Well, of course
you might not. He&rsquo;s an inspector, works in a
back room. But in a place like this he&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s
known as the life of the party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In fact,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s why I employed
him. I thought, with his saxophone and his
high spirits he&rsquo;d stir things up. We&rsquo;re a bit
dull in this old town. Well&mdash;&rdquo; he laughed an
uneasy laugh. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s done it all right. He&rsquo;s
stirred us up. See for yourself. He&rsquo;s only been
here three months and he practically runs the
town. Jolly fellow, Hugo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three months,&rdquo; Florence was thinking to
herself. &ldquo;Then he&rsquo;s one of the newcomers. He
might be&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>Her thoughts broke off suddenly. Had she
caught some movement behind her? A door
stood ajar. Her keen eyes caught sight of a
figure that vanished instantly. It was the little
hunchback German, Hans Schneider, one of
her suspects,&mdash;she was sure of that.</p>
<p>As if he had read her thoughts, Danby said:
&ldquo;The German people are the cleverest dye
makers in the world. While the World War
was on and we could not get their dyes, we
made some very poor cloth I can tell you. But
now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not finish. She knew what he would
have said: &ldquo;Now if we can but find this spy,
if we can protect our interests, we shall lead
the world and our little city may become the
center of a great industry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t dance to that sort of music?&rdquo; he
said, nodding his head toward the squealing,
squawking, sobbing orchestra.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it music?&rdquo; Florence smiled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder!&rdquo; He did not smile. He was
watching the younger people in this mad
whirlpool of motion and sound. &ldquo;Sometimes I
wonder,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been told that this
jazz started in the dark heart of Africa, or
perhaps in the black Republic of Haiti. That it
used to be practiced as a wild, frenzied dance,
mingled with a sort of madness, by the Voodoo
worshippers before they performed something
terrible&mdash;perhaps human sacrifice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway&mdash;&rdquo; his voice changed, &ldquo;this wild
revel does things to our people. There&rsquo;s sure
to be things happen tomorrow, a whole batch
of color spoiled perhaps, or bolts of cloth
ruined, perhaps valuable machines wrecked.
People are nervous and jumpy after just one
wild night. You can&rsquo;t trust them to be themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last time we had a revel like this,&rdquo; he
laughed low, &ldquo;one of the girls was working
near a vat of indigo blue coloring matter. She&mdash;she
tried a new jazz step, I believe,&mdash;and&mdash;fell
in! She was blue for a week after that.&rdquo;
He laughed aloud. Florence joined him and
felt better. Her night of waltz music was
spoiled, but here at least was amusement. &ldquo;She
would have been blue for life,&rdquo; Danby went on,
&ldquo;only the coloring material wasn&rsquo;t in its last
stages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo; he rose. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be going. Got a lot
of work to do. No more waltz tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no more waltz!&rdquo; Florence looked up
at her imitation moon. She was disappointed
and unhappy. She had pictured that last dance
as something unusual and beautiful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Hugo is attractive at any rate,&rdquo; she
said to Danby.</p>
<p>Just at that moment Hugo went whirling
by. He was dancing with Ina Piccalo, the
dark-eyed girl who had carried away the dye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s wearing a purple dress,&rdquo; Florence
said to herself, &ldquo;the very shade that was in the
ink bottle. I wonder&mdash;&rdquo; she was to wonder
many times.</p>
<p>It was not many hours after Florence had
returned to her small room in the bird-cage
cottage, when Jeanne, in quite a different part
of the country, started on her strange flight
following the small silver plane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can have happened?&rdquo; Madame Bihari
asked herself in utter astonishment as she
watched the two planes, like homing pigeons,
rapidly disappearing into the distance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>That which had happened was truly very
simple. As Jeanne, after taxiing down the field,
came in sight of that silver plane, she caught
sight of a tall dark figure just entering the
plane. One look was enough. Her lips parted
in sudden surprise as she hissed under her
breath: &ldquo;The dark lady! The spy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was about to spring from her place
when the silver plane, whose propeller had
been slowly revolving, started gliding away.
There was nothing left but to follow.</p>
<p>Jeanne followed, not alone on the ground,
but in the air. And did she follow? Miles and
miles the two planes roared on. Perhaps some
early milkman, looking up at the sky, wondered
where they were going. Jeanne wondered
also, but not once did she think of turning
back. In her mind&rsquo;s eye, she could see the
earnest look on Danby&rsquo;s face. She could picture
his happy little city and her friend Florence
working there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll catch that so terrible spy,&rdquo; she told
herself. &ldquo;Somehow I <i>must</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We feel certain that she would have accomplished
her purpose, but for one thing. She
and Madame had traveled far on the previous
day. Their supply of gas was low. Just when
Jeanne fancied that the silver plane was slowing
up for a landing, her motor gave an angry
sput-sput-sput, then went quite dead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No gas!&rdquo; she exclaimed in sudden consternation.</p>
<p>Wildly her eyes sought the earth beneath
her. There were plowed fields to the right and
left of her, very soft and dangerous, she knew.
Directly before her were corn shocks, hundreds
of them. There were wide spaces between
the shocks. Could she land between
them?</p>
<p>With a little prayer to the god of the air,
she set her plane to go gliding in a circle and
land as nearly as possible in one particular
spot.</p>
<p>She missed the spot and the space between
the shocks completely. With a sudden intake
of breath, she saw herself headed for an endless
row of shocks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God take pity on one poor little gypsy
girl!&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>The plane bumped softly. A brown bundle
shot past her, another and another, five, ten,
twenty. The earth and sky turned brown.
Then, her plane quite buried in brown, she
came to a standstill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>Realizing the danger from fire, she leaped
from the plane to begin dragging at the bundles
of corn fodder that covered her motor. To
her surprise, she discovered that someone on
the other side was engaged in the same occupation.
When at last the motor was quite clear,
a freckled youth, with two front teeth gone,
came round the side to grin at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ll have t&rsquo;set &rsquo;em all up ag&rsquo;in, I
reckon.&rdquo; He cackled a merry cackle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no; you set them up.&rdquo; Jeanne joined
him in the laugh. Then, digging deep in her
knickers pocket, she dragged forth a new five
dollar bill. &ldquo;You take this and get me some
gas. You can keep the rest. Just enough gas
to take me to the landing field. Where is the
nearest one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks! Er&mdash;&rdquo; the boy paused to cackle
again. &ldquo;Them shocks was just husked. I
husked &rsquo;em. Weren&rsquo;t tied none. If they wasn&rsquo;t
husked you&rsquo;d might nigh cracked up, I
reckon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get the gas,&rdquo; he added hurriedly. &ldquo;Sure
I will. Landin&rsquo; field over thar.&rdquo; He pointed
north. &ldquo;Ten miles. How come you all didn&rsquo;t
stop thar?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No gas.&rdquo; Jeanne smiled a happy smile.
&ldquo;But say! You hurry!&rdquo; she put in as he moved
slowly away. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a lady cop of the air. I was
chasing a spy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee Whillikins! A spy!&rdquo; The boy was
away on the run.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVI</span>
<br />A SUSPICIOUS CHARACTER</h2>
<p>Jeanne had lost her spy. She had lost herself
as well. Only after much flying and
four landings was she able to find her way back
to the spot where Madame Bihari patiently
awaited her. When she arrived the sun was
setting once more and it was again time for
tea.</p>
<p>As on the previous night, Jeanne lay long
beneath her canopy of red and gold. But no
silver plane came to shine down upon her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marvelous plane,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Wonder
if I shall ever see it again, or learn the
secret of its shining beauty?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">On the day following the dance, Florence
took a forenoon off to climb to the crest of a
hill that overlooked the city. She sat herself
down upon a heap of fallen leaves, then proceeded
to indulge in an occupation quite unusual
for a girl. Selecting a fine smooth stick
that had lain long enough upon the ground to
become brittle and all sort of &ldquo;whitty,&rdquo; she
began to whittle. A boy cousin had long ago
introduced her to the joyous art of whittling.
What did she make? Mostly nothing at all.
She just whittled. And as she carved away at
the brittle wood, she thought. Long, deep
thoughts they were too. Ah yes, there was
the charm of whittling&mdash;it made thinking
easy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If it wasn&rsquo;t all so tranquil and beautiful,
I&rsquo;d leave it,&rdquo; she thought as her eyes took in
the scene beneath her feet. Yes, it surely was
beautiful. The red brick factory, built beside
a rushing stream, quite old and all covered
with vines, had a quiet charm all its own. Beside
it, reflecting the golden glory of autumn
trees, was the millpond. Beyond that the water
flowing over the dam, sparkled like a thousand
diamonds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;it is beautiful. I did
not know that old New England could be so
entrancing. And yet, it is not the city, the factory,
the hills, the trees that hold you. It&rsquo;s
the people.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>This was true. There was the little family
in the canary-cage house who had taken her
in. The room she and Verna occupied was so
small. There was hardly room to move about.
Yet they were happy. Verna was obliging,
kind and generous to a fault. More important
than that, she was eager to know about everything.
And she, Florence, knew so many, many
things about which this child of a small city
had scarcely dreamed. They talked at night,
hours on end.</p>
<p>Strangely enough as she thought of this
flower-like girl, a sudden mental image gave
her a picture of Hugo, the idol of last night&rsquo;s
affair. She could see him now as plainly as she
might if his picture had been thrown upon a
screen before her. His dark eyes were flashing,
his tangled hair tossing, his white teeth
gleaming, as he exclaimed: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine! Now
let&rsquo;s have a little jazz!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shuddered. Somehow, she did not wish
to think of Verna and Hugo at the same instant.
And yet if asked why, she could not
have found a sensible reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; she said to the trees, the hills and
the city before her, &ldquo;he is handsome, gallant
and popular. Who could ask for more?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>And the hills seemed to echo back, &ldquo;Who?
Who? Who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah yes, who? For all this, Florence was
experiencing a feeling of unhappiness over the
whole affair. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she asked herself.
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not have high social ambitions, of
this she was certain. Happiness, she knew,
could not be attained by sitting close to the
head of the table at a banquet, nor of being
intimate with great and rich people. Happiness
came from within. And yet this had been
her first little social venture. Always before
she had worked in the gymnasium or on the
playground. This time she had planned something
different, planned it well. She had
dreamed a new dream and the thing had not
turned out as she had expected. The thing
she had planned would, she had hoped, be
beautiful. Had this affair ended beautifully?
She was to be told in a few hours that it had
been wonderful. Just now she was thinking,
&ldquo;There was plenty of noise.&rdquo; Once Hugo had
dumped out a whole bank of flowers to seize the
tub that had held them, and beat it for a drum.
Everyone had laughed and shouted. There
had been no beautiful moonlight waltz at the
end, only a wild burst of sound.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Probably I&rsquo;m soft and sentimental,&rdquo; she
told herself. &ldquo;And yet&mdash;&rdquo; she was thinking of
Danby Force. &ldquo;Our people,&rdquo; he had said,
&ldquo;seemed a little dull, so I hired Hugo. Thought
he might stir them up with his saxophone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He <i>had</i> stirred them up&mdash;some of them.
Some remained just as they had been. Her
little family in the canary-cage house were
that sort. They lived simply, quietly, snugly
in that tiny house. They did not ask for a bigger
house. They had no car. They did not
crave excitement. Their lives were like small,
deep, still running streams.</p>
<p>Once those streams had been disturbed, horribly
disturbed. That was when the mill shut
down four years before. It was Tom Maver,
father of the family, who had told her about
it. Tom was a small, quiet sort of man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve worked in the mill since I was sixteen,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Always tending a bank of spinning
wheels. Never did anything else. We were
happy. Had our home, our garden, our little
orchard all snug and cozy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; he had sighed, &ldquo;mills down south
where labor is cheap, child labor and all that,
cut in on our trade. The mill shut down. I
had to find work. I went to a farm. They set
me cutting corn, by hand. The corn was taller
than I was, and heavier. I lasted three days.
My face and hands were cut, and my back
nearly broken. I was sick when I came home.&rdquo;
A look of pain overspread his honest face. &ldquo;I
tried ditch-digging and, in winter, putting up
ice. That was terrible. I fell in and was nearly
drowned. After that I&mdash;I just gave up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;we didn&rsquo;t starve, but
we didn&rsquo;t miss it much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now,&rdquo; he added brightly, &ldquo;the mill is
running and we are happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Florence thought to herself, &ldquo;they
say they are happy, and I believe they are.
And that&rsquo;s what counts most&mdash;happiness.&rdquo;
Yes, that was it. They did not need jazz
and a saxophone, a grinning Hugo and his
roaring tub to make them happy. They had
something better, a simple, kindly peace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jazz,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;It seems to get into
people&rsquo;s very lives.&rdquo; She was thinking now
of a friend, a beautiful girl not yet twenty. Her
life was a round of jazz dances. Her doctor
had ordered her to an island in Lake Superior
for her health. She had been taking drugs
for hay fever. This was affecting her heart.
On this island there was no hay fever. She had
escaped hay fever, but there was no jazz and
her cigarettes ran out. &ldquo;In another week I
should have died&mdash;simply died,&rdquo; she had said
to Florence. And Florence knew she had
spoken the truth. &ldquo;How terrible to become
a slave to habits that are not necessary to our
lives!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;And yet, I must not
judge others. I only can try to select the best
from both the old and the new for myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she sat there looking down upon the
city, thinking of its joys and its sorrows, its
successes and its perils, she was like some
brooding Greek goddess dreaming of the
future.</p>
<p>Suddenly she stood up straight and tall.
Flinging her arms wide, she remained thus,
motionless as a statue. She was beautiful, was
this girl of strong heart and a strong body,
beautiful as heroic Greek statuary is beautiful.
Standing there, she saw the sun come out
from behind a cloud to bathe the hillside with
its glory of light. Racing down the hill, this
narrow patch of light appeared at last to linger
lovingly over the little city.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is a sign,&rdquo; the girl whispered. &ldquo;In the
end troubles shall be banished!&rdquo; For the moment
her face was transfigured by some
strange light from within. Then she turned to
walk slowly down the hill.</p>
<p>As she entered the grounds that surrounded
the mill, she was startled to see a strange figure
half hidden by a wild cranberry bush at a
spot near the gate. At first she believed him
to be hiding there and thought swiftly, &ldquo;This
may be the spy!&rdquo; Next instant she realized
that he was raking dead leaves from beneath
the bush.</p>
<p>A strange, rather horrible sort of person he
appeared to be. His hair was kinky and cut
short, his dark face all but covered with a
short curly beard. His bare arms were long
and hairy. As he rested there, bent over, clawing
at the leaves, he resembled an ape. He
grinned horribly at the girl as she passed, but
did not speak.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>&ldquo;One more newcomer to the community,&rdquo;
was her mental comment. &ldquo;But of course,
since he works about the yard he does not
enter the mill. He could scarcely be the spy.
And yet&mdash;&rdquo; she wondered how strong the locks
and bolts of doors and windows were and
whether it were possible, after all, for the spy
to come from without, at night.</p>
<p>On enquiry she was to discover that at night
the plant was guarded by a watchman, one of
the oldest employees of the place, and entirely
trustworthy.</p>
<p>For the moment, however, she was bent on
entering the mill. She liked its din, loved to
see the speeding shuttles and feel the movement
of life about her. Besides, she had not
forgotten what Danby Force had said:
&ldquo;Things often happen in the mill after a jazz
night.&rdquo; She thought of the girl who had fallen
into a vat of blue dye. &ldquo;Has anything happened
today, I wonder?&rdquo; she whispered to herself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVII</span>
<br />A SURPRISE VISIT</h2>
<p>To Florence with her interest in mechanical
things and her love for the glorious
throb of life, the cotton mill was a place of
great enchantment. As she entered now she
was greeted by the crack-crack-crack of a
hundred shuttles and by the boom-bang of
weavers&rsquo; beams.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds like a battle,&rdquo; she told herself.
&ldquo;And so it is&mdash;a battle against depression, cold,
hunger and despair.&rdquo; She looked about her.
Everywhere hands were busy, faces bright and
hearts light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to think,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;all unknown
to these honest, happy ones, there
hangs above them a shadow like some great
bombing airplane, a shadow that some day
may drop a bomb as if from the sky upon all
this glorious harmony of noise and still it forever.
Unless&mdash;&rdquo; she was thinking of the spy
who, all undiscovered, lingered in their midst.
He was a thief. No, he did not take their
money, nor their other trifling treasures. He
took their means of living&mdash;or would if he
could.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And who is he?&rdquo; she asked herself. &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;
She thought of the hunchback German who
tended the motors, of the two dark-faced silent
sisters who so resembled the spy that had
escaped. &ldquo;That one too may come back,&rdquo; she
told herself. Danby Force had said that he
was sure they had not discovered all the secrets.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a complicated process. Each secret
is known by only one or two workers.&rdquo; These
had been his words. &ldquo;No one of them knows
all of it.&rdquo; She thought of the black-eyed girl
she had seen carrying away the bottle of dye
stuff. &ldquo;She may have wanted to analyse it,&rdquo;
she thought. &ldquo;More likely that she merely
used it to dye that dress she wore last night.&rdquo;
She laughed in spite of herself. Then she recalled
the little ape-like man working out
there among the shrubbery. He might know
a great deal. Who could tell?</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one knows now.&rdquo; She clenched her
hands tight. &ldquo;But we shall know!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>That evening after working hours she was
favored with a surprise visit. She had entered
her tiny room in the canary-cage house. Weary
and perplexed, wondering uneasily whether
she had as yet been of any real service to this
unusual community, and wondering too in a
disturbed sort of way whether she should not
tell Danby Force there was no use of her staying
longer, she threw herself on her bed and
had fallen half asleep when a touch like the
brush of a feather awakened her.</p>
<p>At once she sprang to a sitting position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is I, Verna.&rdquo; There followed a low laugh.
&ldquo;You have a caller. And such a romantic one!
You&rsquo;d never guess.&rdquo; Verna laughed a low,
happy laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Danby Force is not romantic,&rdquo; said the big
girl, fumbling at her hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s not Mr. Force,&rdquo; said Verna. Her
cheeks, Florence saw, were flushed. &ldquo;It is
Hugo, Hugo!&rdquo; There was a note of deep admiration
in her tone as she repeated the name
a second time softly: &ldquo;Hugo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Hugo?&rdquo; Florence started. Hugo, the
one who had stolen her act, was here to see
her. She wondered why. And, what was more,
this lovely school girl admired him greatly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see him?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Oh! I wish I had!&rdquo; Verna clasped
her hands. &ldquo;Mother opened the door. She
seated him, then called me from the kitchen
to tell you. Aren&rsquo;t you thrilled? You are not
hurrying at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Florence said quietly, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t wise to
hurry&mdash;at least not for a man.&rdquo; She smiled
at this, then gave the girl a pat on the cheek.</p>
<p>She found herself considerably disturbed as
she stepped into the little parlor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Hugo, the magnificent, sprang to his
feet at sight of her. And he was, in his own
way, magnificent,&mdash;bright blue suit, orange
colored tie, a flower in his buttonhole, a smile
showing all his white teeth. &ldquo;Ah, Miss Huyler.
I came to congratulate you, to tell you
how wonderful the party was last night. You
certainly are a marvelous hostess. We of the
mill&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke short off to stare at something on
the wall. He stood there for a count of ten,
then he murmured, &ldquo;How exquisite! How
charmingly beautiful!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>He was looking at a picture. It was indeed
beautiful. Done by a very great artist who
had chanced to visit the little city, it was carefully
done,&mdash;a picture of a very beautiful face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Florence said quietly, &ldquo;that is a picture
of Verna, the daughter of this house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say she lives&mdash;that she is
real!&rdquo; The man&rsquo;s astonishment was genuine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Florence replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must meet her.&rdquo; Hugo smiled a dazzling
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s only a child in high school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;High school,&rdquo; he murmured low. &ldquo;Ah, that
is the age of romance, of exquisite grace and
beauty. I must meet her,&rdquo; he repeated.</p>
<p>For just no real reason at all Florence
wished to say, &ldquo;I hope you never do,&rdquo; and
there came also a temptation to emphasize
her thought with two or three words that do
not often appear in print. What she did say
was, &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you have a seat? You wanted
to see me about something?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;ah&mdash;&rdquo; Hugo appeared to dance
toward a chair. He sat down with the flourish
of an expert rider mounting a horse. &ldquo;Yes,&mdash;er&mdash;&rdquo;
He was on his feet again, circling about
that picture. At last, like a bee that has circled
a flower, his gaze came to a center close
to the picture. &ldquo;Ah yes,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;A
very great artist. A priceless thing!&rdquo; Heaving
a sigh, he tore himself away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss Huyler.&rdquo; His change of poise
and tone was fairly stunning. As he wheeled
about he was once more the social conquistador,
seeking, the girl knew not what advantage.
&ldquo;Yes, Miss Huyler, we admire you. In
fact we enjoyed the party so much we wish
you to organize another within a week, a truly
wonderful party, a harvest ball. A thing to
be done in costume, a masked ball.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence might have reminded him that she
had started her little social meeting as one
sort of affair and that he had ended it in quite
a different manner. She might have told him
that if he wanted any sort of party at all, he
was quite free to get it up as he chose. She
did nothing of the kind. Instead, she said:
&ldquo;And does Mr. Force approve?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Force!&rdquo; Hugo made a dismissing gesture.
&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t mind. He wants this dead
old town wakened up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he?&rdquo; Florence said quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he?&rdquo; Hugo stared. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that why
you&rsquo;re here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>Florence started. &ldquo;Yes, yes, I suppose that
is why I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; she replied hurriedly. It
would never do for any of these people to
guess why she was here. &ldquo;Yes. And I am
sure the party will be all right. I can count
on your assistance and&mdash;and all the others?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely! Absolutely! That&rsquo;s the spirit!&rdquo;
Hugo sprang forward to grasp her hand.
For Florence that was a disturbing handclasp.
Hugo&rsquo;s hand was hot and trembling. After
holding her hand ten seconds too long for her
comfort, he suddenly dropped it to do three
more turns about the room. Then, making a
grab at his hat, and snatching a look at his
watch, he exclaimed: &ldquo;Must be going!&rdquo; At that
he bolted out of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a remarkable person!&rdquo; she thought
a trifle wearily. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a living impersonation
of jazz.&rdquo; He was a great deal more than that,
but this she was to discover at a later date.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>In the meantime she went to her room for
a look at her mail. This was followed by a
few moments of thinking. Those were very
solemn thoughts indeed. &ldquo;How,&rdquo; she asked
herself, &ldquo;is this affair to end? Shall I discover
the spy? If so, how and when? Will the spy
be a man or a woman? Will there be a struggle,
a trial perhaps?&rdquo; She shuddered. &ldquo;After
all,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;perhaps I should have accomplished
more by attempting to follow the
dark lady&rsquo;s trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In time her thoughts began to wander. She
thought of Hugo. &ldquo;At least,&rdquo; she told herself,
&ldquo;he has good taste in art. That is a lovely picture
of Verna.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Drawn by this thought, she left her room
to wander into the small living room. Instantly
her lips parted in a suppressed cry of
surprise. <i>The picture was gone!</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;But then,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;why raise an
alarm? I have been out of the room for some
time. Perhaps a member of the family has
carried it away.&rdquo; She decided at last upon a
course of watchful waiting. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find it in another
room,&rdquo; she told herself. But would she?</p>

<br />THE RED DEVIL</h2>
<p>Has the little airplane stewardess been
quite forgotten? Such vivid personalities
as hers are never long forgotten. These
were busy days for her. A trip to Boston and
return; a day of rest; a sudden call for a special
trip to the Arizona desert&mdash;she was ever
on the wing.</p>
<p>With all this she had not forgotten her
promise to Danby Force. Pictures of the dark
lady with a torn ear were made and quietly
distributed among her fellow-workers. She
was surprised at the results. Ladies resembling
this suspected one began, it seemed to
her, to travel by air in whole platoons. She
heard from one in Dallas, another in Boston.
One was seen boarding a plane in Seattle and
another in Portland, Maine. One and all were
investigated and found lacking in one particular
or another. So, at the end of a week the
missing lady was still missing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>One day the chief stewardess said to her,
&ldquo;I have a very interesting request for your
services. You&rsquo;ll want to go, I&rsquo;m sure. A group
of very learned people are to visit a little city
down east called Happy Vale. Ever hear of
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Happy Vale.&rdquo; Rosemary said the words
slowly. Then with a sudden start she exclaimed,
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the home of Danby Force.
That&rsquo;s where the industrial spies are supposed
to be at work. I wonder&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She broke off to stare out of the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she said in a changed tone.
&ldquo;Surely, I&rsquo;ll be glad to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Danby Force,&rdquo; she thought as she left the
room. &ldquo;He must have requested that I come
with the party. I wonder if it has anything to
do with the dark lady. Wonder if he&rsquo;s found
her, wants me to identify her, or&mdash;or something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; she concluded, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a fine young
man. It will be a real adventure to visit his
city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, as if Fate had whispered some word
of warning in her ear, she made her way slowly
toward a certain hangar.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>Arrived at the hangar she sought out a
certain airplane, then called:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry! Oh Jerry! Come here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At your service!&rdquo; said Jerry, a bright young
mechanic, grinning broadly as he extended a
greasy hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Jerry.&rdquo; The girl gripped his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;have you time to look
over this motor a bit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, Miss Sample. But what&mdash;why that
plane belongs to Willie VanGeldt, the rich
young bum. Why&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry,&rdquo; Rosemary smiled, &ldquo;curiosity once
killed a cat. Will you look it over while I go
in and make my report?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, Miss Sample.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later when Rosemary reappeared,
Jerry made a wry face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Terrible, Miss Sample, just terrible! Carbon
in the cylinders, oil in the spark plugs,
everything wrong! Wonder it runs at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame!&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;It really is!
Here we are keeping everything perfect. Motors
dragged out and overhauled every three
hundred hours, everything just perfect. And
these amateurs!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know, Jerry,&rdquo; Rosemary broke in. &ldquo;But
tell me, have you a couple of mechanics who&rsquo;d
like to earn some overtime by overhauling this
motor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That motor? Willie VanGeldt&rsquo;s? You pay
for it? Honest, Miss Sample, he&rsquo;s not worth
it! He ain&rsquo;t worth much of anything. That&rsquo;s
my guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone is worth something,&rdquo; Rosemary
replied soberly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to see him get
himself killed. It will be bad for aviation in
general. And besides, Jerry, I&rsquo;ve a feeling
about that airplane&mdash;one I can&rsquo;t explain. So
you just get that motor fixed up, and I&rsquo;ll pay
the men, pay them tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Miss Sample. But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosemary had vanished.</p>
<p>So Rosemary Sample, still dreaming of her
approaching visit to Happy Vale, crossed the
airport grounds, and entered the low depot to
order a sandwich and cup of coffee, and to sit
staring absently at the wall until the coffee
was cold.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>At the same time, in a far away city coming
events were casting their shadows before
them, and in that very city the little French
girl Petite Jeanne was preparing for a visit
to a great concert hall. This visit was to have
the most astounding results. So, like some
famous stage manager, Fate was getting
ready to assemble the cast for the final scenes
in our little drama.</p>
<p>Even while Rosemary Sample sat staring
at the ceiling, Florence was saying to Danby
Force: &ldquo;I think the Harvest Dance would be
a fine thing. Not that we harvest anything but
bright prints,&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;But these golden
days surely call for glorious good times.
Only&mdash;&rdquo; she hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only what?&rdquo; He urged her on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we could lay out a plan and stick to
it, in&mdash;in spite&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In spite of our good man Hugo,&rdquo; he
laughed. &ldquo;Well, this time we&rsquo;ll do just that.
We&rsquo;ll arrange an attractive printed program.
On the card every other offering will be an
old-fashioned dance. The last shall be a waltz
in your artificial moonlight. And I&mdash;&rdquo; he
laughed low. &ldquo;I speak for that last dance
right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Florence flushed in spite of herself.
&ldquo;And I&mdash;I accept.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; she said a moment later,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought of something that might be
done. The floor, you know, is very large. Why
not send out in the country and get a dozen
corn shocks and set them up about the room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dance among the corn shocks!&rdquo; Danby
Force exclaimed. &ldquo;A great idea! We&rsquo;ll do it.
We&rsquo;ll have the place lighted with imitation
jack-o-lanterns. That will be a grand ball indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And it was, even for Florence, up to a certain
point. Then something happened, as
things have a way of doing, that for a time at
least spoiled her fun.</p>
<p>The mixed program of modern and old-fashioned
dances served to hold the hilarity to
a moderate level. More than once a man in a
red devil costume, whom Florence recognized
as Hugo, attempted to bribe the musicians into
changing the program, but it was no go. They
had their orders. They would follow them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>It was this same red devil who caused all of
Florence&rsquo;s trouble, which in the end turned
into quite a joy. She was standing on the side
line between dances when the red devil peeked
round a corn shock, then as he approached her
whispered, &ldquo;I am told that this beautiful child
who lives at your house is here. Do me the
favor to tell me how she is dressed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I really don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Florence was
both surprised and frightened. She had not
known that Verna was to be there. Indeed
she was under the impression that her parents
had forbidden her coming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes you know!&rdquo; the red devil hissed in
her ear. &ldquo;You know well enough, but you
won&rsquo;t tell. It&rsquo;s all right. I&rsquo;ll find out. I take
what I want!&rdquo; There was a serpent-like hiss
in his voice. Then he was gone.</p>
<p>Florence stared at the corn shock behind
which he had vanished. Her mind was in a
whirl. Was Verna truly here? If she was, she
must find and warn her. The words of Rosa,
tragic words, came to her: &ldquo;He is a bad, bad
man!&rdquo; His own words still rang in her ears:
&ldquo;I take what I want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he?&rdquo; she asked herself fiercely. &ldquo;Perhaps
he does.&rdquo; Strangely enough, she saw in
her mind&rsquo;s eye at that moment the picture of
Verna.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>Florence had developed an unusual gift.
She had discovered long ago that she could
recognize friends, even at some distance, by
their habitual movements. If they were walking,
rowing or playing a game, it was all the
same. She had developed this gift until now
she could recognize people instantly under any
circumstances. &ldquo;I must find Verna,&rdquo; she whispered,
gripping at her heart to still its wild
panic.</p>
<p>A dance began. Her partner came to claim
her. It chanced to be a waltz. As she floated
about among the corn shocks, she was looking,
looking, looking.</p>
<p>And then she saw her. &ldquo;A fairy!&rdquo; she whispered
to herself. &ldquo;Verna is dressed as a fairy,
all in white, with wings. How exquisite!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She wanted to break away and warn her at
once. This might make a scene. She would
wait until the dance was over. She lost sight
of her entirely.</p>
<p>Never before had a waltz seemed so long.
She glided in and out among the corn shocks,
in and out, in and out, until it seemed to her
that dawn must come and a new day begin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>When at last the music stopped she fairly
tore herself from her partner and was away
on her quest. But where was that white fairy?
Ten minutes of frantic search convinced her
that she was too late. Verna was not there.
Neither was the red devil.</p>
<p>Sick at heart, she crept away to the dressing
room. There she sank into a chair to surrender
herself to despair. But not for long. Before
her was a wooden bench. On this bench
lay a large suit of rough coveralls, a pair of
cotton gloves and an ugly mask. This was
a corn husker&rsquo;s outfit abandoned by one of the
masqueraders. Ten minutes later Florence
had vanished; so too had the coveralls, mask
and gloves.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later the red devil and the
exquisite fairy might have been seen walking
along a narrow bridle path, lined on either
side by tall bushes. The red devil, if observed
by some old, wise person, would have been
said to be in the act of practicing his art. He
was doing, at that moment, nothing that might
be called reprehensible. He was in the act of
beguiling the exquisite fairy. That was all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>Surely no more perfect setting could have
been found for a love tryst. The moon, full
and golden, hung over great masses of dark
foliage. The air was filled with faint noises,
the chirp of a cricket, the rasping of a katydid,
the call of some bird in his sleep, the distant
bay of a hound. The air touched the
fairy&rsquo;s cheek like a faint caress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are beautiful,&rdquo; the red devil murmured
low.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; the fairy breathed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More lovely than a flower, more delicate
than a rose, more graceful than&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The red devil broke off suddenly to listen.
&ldquo;Thought I heard a sound.&rdquo; His voice took on
a sudden gruffness.</p>
<p>A moment later he was his own sweet devil
of a self again, murmuring: &ldquo;If I had all the
flowers of this beautiful world I would not
look at them, but at you. If I might touch the
stars I would touch your hand instead. Your
lips&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had by this time all but reached the
end of the lane. One moment more, and they
would have been in the open woods, when
something quite terrible occurred.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>A figure that loomed large in the half darkness
leaped at the red devil. Startled, the red
devil swung out with both fists. He missed.
Something very like a sledge-hammer struck
him on the side of the jaw. With one wild
scream, the exquisite fairy was away. But
not the red devil.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIX</span>
<br />THE FIRE-BIRD</h2>
<p>Strange as it may seem, it was at this
very hour that Petite Jeanne received one
of the most unusual thrills of her not uneventful
life. She and Madame Bihari were back in
Chicago. The Ballet Russe, too, was in that
city. And to Jeanne who, as you may know,
was one of the finest of gypsy dancers, anything
like the Ballet Russe was a call which,
if need be, would draw from her purse the last
silver coin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Ballet Russe!&rdquo; she exclaimed to Madame.
&ldquo;We must go. And ah yes, tonight we
must go! This is the last performance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible, my pretty one,&rdquo; Madame said
with slow regret. &ldquo;I have promised to say
farewell to our good friends of Bohemia. They
are leaving tomorrow for their native land.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But you, my child, you must go. Put on
your bright gown of a thousand beads and
your purple cape with the white fox collar, and
go. Surely no one, not even the Fire-Bird, shall
outshine my Petite Jeanne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Jeanne went alone. She secured a seat
at the side of the gallery where she might look
almost directly down upon the dancers. And
was that an hour of pure joy for Jeanne! Not
for months had she witnessed anything half
so charming. The lights were so bright, the
costumes so beautiful, the dancers so light-footed
and droll, and the music so entrancing
that she at times believed herself transported
to another world.</p>
<p>The first piece was a bit of exquisite nonsense.
But when the time came for that entrancing
story, &ldquo;The Fire-Bird,&rdquo; to be told in
pantomime, music and dancing, Jeanne sat entranced.
Once before, as a small child, she
had seen this in Paris. Now it came to her as
a thing of renewed and eternal beauty.</p>
<p>As the lights of the great Auditorium went
dark and the orchestra took up an entrancing
strain, Jeanne saw at the back of the stage a
tree that seemed all aglow with light. And
before this tree, dancing like some enchanted
fairy, was a creature that, in that uncertain
light, seemed half maiden, half bird.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Fire-Bird!&rdquo; Jeanne&rsquo;s lips formed the
words they did not speak.</p>
<p>Soon the beautiful, glimmering Fire-Bird began
to seem ill at ease. The shadow of a young
man appeared in the background.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prince Ivan,&rdquo; Jeanne whispered.</p>
<p>The Prince pursued the Fire-Bird. Round
and round they danced. How light was the
step of the Fire-Bird! She seemed scarcely a
feather&rsquo;s weight. How Jeanne envied her!</p>
<p>And yet there were those who would have
said, &ldquo;Petite Jeanne is a more splendid
dancer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince seized the Fire-Bird in his arms.
She struggled in vain to escape. She entreated
him. She attempted to charm and beguile him.
He released her only, in beautiful and fantastic
dance rhythm, to capture her again. At last,
on being given one of her shining feathers as
a charm against all evil, he granted her the
freedom she asked.</p>
<p>The Fire-Bird vanishes. Day begins to
dawn upon the stage. The music is low and enchanting.
Then a bevy of dancing girls
emerge from a castle gate. These are Princesses,
bewitched and enslaved by a wizard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>As the thirteen Princesses danced upon the
stage, Jeanne received a momentary shock.
One of these, the third from their leader, had
about her an air of familiarity. Jeanne was a
dancer. She had learned to recognize other
dancers by their movements. But this one&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where have I seen her?&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>Closing her eyes, she attempted to call
forth upon the dimly lighted picture gallery of
memory some scene of other days, some open
air arena, some stage where this one had
danced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; She tapped her small foot. &ldquo;It
will not come. And yet I <i>have</i> seen her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then again she gave herself over to the
story unfolding so beautifully before her.</p>
<p>In the story played out for Jeanne, Prince
Ivan falls in love with the most beautiful of
the enchanted Princesses. There follows a
marvelous dance done by the maidens. Jeanne
as she watched had eyes for but one dancer,
the mysterious person she felt she should
know, but could not recall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>Dawn comes. The enchanted ones disappear
through the gate of the castle. Prince
Ivan, in the abandon of love, follows. There
comes the unearthly din of gongs and bells. A
host of weird creatures come out to attack him.
They are powerless because of the magic
feather, gift of the Fire-Bird. Ivan is not
afraid.</p>
<p>Then comes the terrible wizard who, if he
could, would destroy Ivan with his very
breath.</p>
<p>For the time Jeanne forgot the mysterious
dancer who had once more appeared upon the
scene. Carried away by the story, Jeanne had
eyes only for the brave little Prince and the
terrible creature who seeks his destruction.
As the wizard approaches step by step, his
hand trembling with rage, his small hard foot
stamping the floor, Jeanne actually trembled
with fear. Then, as Prince Ivan waved the
magic feather and called upon the Fire-Bird to
aid him, when the splendid dancing Fire-Bird
appeared upon the scene, Jeanne wanted to
scream for joy.</p>
<p>Such enchantment passes rapidly. When at
last Ivan had triumphed and the wizard been
destroyed, Jeanne thought again of the mysterious
dancer who had, she was sure, played
some part in her past life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you please&mdash;&rdquo; she spoke to her nearest
neighbor whose opera glass dangled idly from
a ribbon. &ldquo;Just for one moment, may I borrow
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo; The lady smiled.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, as she put the glass to
her eyes, the little French girl found herself
all atremble. &ldquo;Coming events cast their shadows
before them.&rdquo; Scarcely had the glass been
focussed upon the mysterious dancer than her
hand dropped limply to her lap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It cannot be!&rdquo; she murmured aloud. &ldquo;But
yes! It is she! It can be no other. There is the
dark face. Even beneath her make-up one
feels it. There is the torn ear. I can&rsquo;t be wrong.
It is the dark lady! It is the spy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twenty seconds later the opera glasses were
in their owner&rsquo;s hands. Jeanne had vanished.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="small">CHAPTER XX</span>
<br />SOMEONE VANISHES</h2>
<p>Poor red devil! He surely was in for it!</p>
<p>What a pity that anyone so jolly, so full
of the froth and bubble of life, should find any
hard spots on his joyous glide through life!
Pity or no pity, he was in for it!</p>
<p>He was soft from too much eating, too much
drinking and too many good times. There was
jazz in his blood, plenty of it. But one cannot
defend one&rsquo;s self with the jittering rhythm of
jazz. Hugo, the red devil, went down and
came up again. He went down and was
soundly beaten by this mysterious intruder.
He roared for help, but there was no help near.
He had chosen a lonely spot for his promenade.
In the end he began whimpering like a baby.
Then the intruder left him. And as he left,
Hugo fancied he heard him mutter, &ldquo;You take
what you want.&rdquo; He was, however, too dazed
and befuddled to tell truly whether he had
heard aright or no.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>When Danby Force came to claim Florence
for the last dance of the evening, he was surprised
to find an unaccustomed wealth of color
in her cheeks. He fancied too that she seemed
agitated and quite unusually excited. Her
breath seemed to come with a little catch.</p>
<p>He said nothing about it and soon they
were floating across the floor to the music of
the old but ever beautiful waltz, &ldquo;Over the
Waves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; Florence whispered as, like light row
boats on moonlit waters they glided on and on,
&ldquo;how beautiful! Nothing could be more wonderful.
I wish it might go on forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Danby Force did not answer. A slight tightening
of the hand was his only reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look!&rdquo; he exclaimed suddenly. &ldquo;Your
knuckles are bleeding!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make
the silly things stop.&rdquo; Deftly she twisted her
handkerchief about the offending knuckles.
Then the dance went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fell upon something rather rough and
bad,&rdquo; she said after a time in quite an absent-minded
manner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Have you found our spy?&rdquo; Danby Force
asked, after thanking her for his good time
when the dance was over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo; Suddenly Florence felt very
weary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m working on it. There&rsquo;s a hunchback
German and two dark-faced ladies and a little
fellow like an ape who rakes leaves. It
must be one of these.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But may not be,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;You will
do well to keep right on looking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what did he mean by that?&rdquo; she asked
herself after he was gone. &ldquo;Does he suspect
someone else, someone who has not even
caught my attention? Perhaps I&rsquo;m not much
good as a lady cop after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that she entered the little cottage that
for the time was her home.</p>
<p>The instant she entered her room she shot
an anxious look toward Verna&rsquo;s bed. Then
she heaved a sigh of relief. Verna was sleeping
peacefully. A single tear that glistened on
her cheek detracted not one whit from her
beauty.</p>
<p>The big girl smiled as her eyes fell upon the
crumpled fairy&rsquo;s wings that lay upon a chair.
&ldquo;Wings all crumpled but the fairy&rsquo;s safe, tha&mdash;thank
God!&rdquo; She choked a little over these
last words.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>For a long time after her light was out, she
lay in her bed looking at the moon shining
through her window. Had one been present
who could see in the dark, he might have
found her lips smiling. Florence was large,
too large and strong for a girl. Many a time
she had shed bitter tears over this. Many a
time too she had looked upon her slim and
willowy sisters and felt her heart burn with
envy. But tonight as she stirred beneath the
covers, as she sensed the glorious strength of
her arms, her limbs, her whole superb body,
she was filled with such a warmth of gladness
as one does not soon forget.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, God!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Thanks
for making me big and strong!&rdquo; At that she
fell asleep.</p>
<p>And tomorrow was another day.</p>
<p class="tb">Back in Chicago the night was not over for
the little French girl. To her unutterable surprise,
she had discovered among the dancing
girls of the Ballet Russe the dark lady who
she believed was the industrial spy. At once
Jeanne had stepped from her place and vanished.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>How she managed to make her way unchallenged
to the wings of the stage, she will
never quite know. Enough that she at last was
there, nor, unless carried away by the heels,
would she budge from the place until she had
gotten one good look at that mysterious lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And after that,&rdquo; she told herself, &ldquo;I shall
call the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the time she had made her way to the
wings of the stage, the last production of the
evening, &ldquo;The Beautiful Blue Danube,&rdquo; had
begun. Nothing ever done by the Ballet Russe
is more charming than the Blue Danube. The
music and dancing were so lovely that for a
space of time Jeanne quite forgot her mission.
But not for long. Soon her eyes were upon the
dancing girls. As, swinging and swaying, rising
on tip-toe, seeming to float in air, they
approached her, she caught her breath, then
whispered: &ldquo;It is this one. No, that one&mdash;or
that one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the end, to her great disappointment, she
discovered that it was not one of them all.
They all had perfect ears.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>What had happened? Had she been mistaken?
Impossible. Had she been tricked?
This was possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But no,&rdquo; she thought to herself. &ldquo;That
dark lady will come on later. In this picture
she has a separate part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, standing on tip-toe, longing every second
to throw away her purple cape and join
the dancers, she watched and waited&mdash;waited
in vain for, when the curtain fell, no dark lady
with a torn ear had appeared upon the stage.</p>
<p>Then of a sudden someone said, &ldquo;Well!
How did you get here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a dancer,&rdquo; Jeanne replied quick-wittedly.
&ldquo;Perhaps after a while I shall be given
a chance to try my skill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, and again perhaps not.&rdquo; The tall,
dark man looked at her doubtfully. But Jeanne,
in her gown of many silver beads and her purple
cape, was very charming. Few could resist
her. So she stayed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But tell me!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;There was
one of the dancing girls I have known. She
was third in the Fire-Bird. Where is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah yes.&rdquo; The tall, dark man shrugged.
&ldquo;Where is she? She is gone.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gone?&rdquo; Jeanne felt her knees sink. &ldquo;She is
gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah yes, Mademoiselle. She came as a substitute
to this country with us. She has been
away. Tonight she comes back. She asks that
she may dance. She is very clever, that one.
We say, &lsquo;You may dance.&rsquo; You have seen, she
danced very well. And now she is gone.&rdquo; He
spread his hands wide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where has she gone?&rdquo; Jeanne demanded
eagerly.</p>
<p>The tall, dark man spread his hands wider
still. &ldquo;Who knows? Not one among us here.
We are through at this city. She will not
come back here. Shall we see her again? Who
can say? She is a queer one, that dancer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Jeanne murmured low, &ldquo;she is a
queer one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that she made her way from the fast
clearing house out into the cool, damp night.
She had wanted to dance on that broad stage.
She wanted to dance no more. The dark lady
had appeared before her very eyes. Now she
was gone. She, Petite Jeanne, had failed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXI</span>
<br />AN ASTONISHING DISCOVERY</h2>
<p>When Jeanne returned from the Ballet
Russe she found Madame Bihari seated
by a low table. Before her, spread out in rows,
were her gypsy witch cards. So intent was her
study of these cards that she did not so much
as notice the little French girl&rsquo;s entrance.
When Jeanne had put away her cape, she
pressed one cold hand against Madame&rsquo;s cheek
to whisper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do the cards say tonight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madame Bihari started. &ldquo;Many things,&rdquo; she
murmured low. &ldquo;Always they speak of many
things, hunger, happiness, sickness, sudden
death, great riches, love, hate, despair. The
cards tell of life, and this, my child, is life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But my Jeanne&mdash;&rdquo; her tone changed. &ldquo;You
have often spoken of a visit to Florence and
Danby Force in their so beautiful city. It is
well that we go tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do the cards say this?&rdquo; Jeanne demanded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I say this.&rdquo; There was a solemn note in
Madame&rsquo;s reply, like the deep tolling of a bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo; Jeanne went skipping across
the floor. &ldquo;Tomorrow we shall go, very early,
perhaps at dawn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanne was happy once more. The dark lady
had escaped her. What of that? Had that not
happened an hour, two hours before? Was
it not already of the past? Was not tomorrow
a new day? On with tomorrow! She did a
wild gypsy dance. At last dancing out of her
dress of a thousand beads, she danced into
dream robes and then into the land of dreams.</p>
<p class="tb">It was on the evening of the next day that
Florence went for a long walk, and made a
startling discovery. These evening walks were
a source of real joy to her. She loved the cool
damp of falling dew on her check; the smell of
wood smoke from a hundred chimneys brought
back pleasant memories of days spent in the
woods along the shores of Lake Huron and
on Isle Royale. She derived a keen satisfaction
from looking in at open windows
where little families sat smiling over their
evening meal or reading beside an open fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>&ldquo;These are <i>my</i> people,&rdquo; she would whisper
to herself. &ldquo;It may lie within my power to do
them a great good. Perhaps tomorrow, or
even tonight within the very next hour I may
discover the spy who is threatening their happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was in just such a frame of mind when,
on passing one of the few truly modern homes
of the town, a rather gaudy Spanish bungalow,
she stopped dead in her tracks. The house
stood quite near the street. In one room the
shades were up and the lights on. She could
see every object within. The chairs, the fancy
spinet desk, the bed covered with a silk spread
of brilliant hue, all stood out before her as if
arranged for inspection. None of these, however,
interested her in the least. The thing
that held her attention was a small picture on
the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be!&rdquo; she breathed. &ldquo;And yet it
is!&rdquo; She moved a little closer. &ldquo;Yes, it is the
picture of Verna, that matchless painting by
a truly great artist.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>At once her mind was in a whirl. What had
happened? Had Mrs. Maver sold that picture?
Impossible. She had said that, whatever happened,
they would never part with that picture.
Had she loaned it? This did not seem
probable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; Florence asked herself, &ldquo;if it
had been stolen, would she not have told me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Strangely enough, at that moment a cold
sweat broke out on her brow. Perhaps the
Mavers had missed the picture. Perhaps they
believed she had taken it. Perhaps for days, all
unknown to her, they had been watching her
movements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How terrible!&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;And I an
amateur lady cop!</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>was</i> stolen!&rdquo; she concluded. &ldquo;And I
know who took it.&rdquo; Words spoken only last
night came back to her: &ldquo;I take what I want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like a flash she was up on the steps and
ringing the bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does the person they call Hugo live here?&rdquo;
she asked the lady who came to the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; the woman replied. &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s not
here just now. We expect him back any time.
Would you care to wait?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll come back later.&rdquo; Florence
turned away to mutter under her breath,
&ldquo;Only I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>For some time after that, in the shadow of
a great elm, she stood watching that room and
that one small picture. Hugo did not appear.
In time the woman of the house opened the
door to snap off the light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Florence drew in a long deep breath.
Her moment had arrived. She moved swiftly.
Screens had been removed from the house.
The window was not locked. To lift it noiselessly,
to step within was the work of seconds.
Moving slowly in the pale moonlight, she
crossed the room. Her hand was on the picture
when a footstep sounded outside. Her
heart stopped beating. What if it were Hugo!
Supposing the moonlight were strong enough
to expose her?</p>
<p>She thought of the night before, and gained
courage. &ldquo;But tonight I am not dressed as a
man.&rdquo; Her heart sank.</p>
<p>The footsteps continued. The person did
not turn in. For the moment she was saved.</p>
<p>Swiftly she re-crossed the room, sprang
through the window and was once more her
own free self walking in the cool damp of
night. The picture was safely hidden under
her jacket.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He takes what he wants.&rdquo; She laughed low
as she hurried along. &ldquo;Well, so do the rest of
us&mdash;sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For all the laugh, she felt depressed. Hugo
a thief! She had not thought this possible.
For all he had interfered with her plans, she
had for this dashing young man a certain admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she sighed at last, &ldquo;we must take
people as we find them. We&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her thoughts broke off suddenly. Some
small object bumped against her leg as she
walked. Putting down a hand she grasped a
small rubber bulb. The bulb was attached to
a tube. She gave a slight pull and it came free
from the picture, behind which it had doubtless
been hidden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s queer!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;One of
Hugo&rsquo;s little secrets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the other end of the tube was a small
cube of black material. The thing did not interest
her overmuch. Perhaps it was a small
atomizer or an affair for spraying perfume.
That Hugo was fond of costly, quite faint perfume,
she knew well. She dropped it in the
pocket of her jacket and there it remained until
the following afternoon when, at Danby
Force&rsquo;s request, she motored up to the stately
old mansion where Danby lived with his
mother.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>She found the young man seated with his
mother in an out-of-doors pavilion. The sun
was bright. It was a rare autumn afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is my mother,&rdquo; Danby said simply.
The beautiful white-haired woman smiled her
a welcome. &ldquo;Danby has been telling me of
you. We are going to have some tea,&rdquo; she said,
motioning Florence to a chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is beautiful up here.&rdquo; Florence took one
long deep breath. It was, just that. The broad-spreading
elms, the wavering shadows, the
bright crimson flowers, all this was marvelous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Danby Force spoke quietly, &ldquo;life has
always been beautiful up here. My father and
his father before him worked to make it so.
But life down in our little city has not always
been beautiful for all. It should be so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment Florence caught some
movement in a tree, a whisk of gray.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A squirrel,&rdquo; Mrs. Force explained. &ldquo;There
must be hundreds of them. We feed them,
place boxes for them in the trees. The gray
ones are brightest, most friendly. Life is always
beautiful for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then Florence put her hand in her
pocket. Feeling something cold and hard, without
thinking what it might be, she drew it out
and held it to view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you get that?&rdquo; Danby exclaimed
on the instant. It was the curious affair Florence
had unintentionally carried away from
Hugo&rsquo;s room the night before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo; the girl stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what it is?&rdquo; Danby broke in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll tell you.&rdquo; He was smiling now.
&ldquo;It is a very small camera, the sort spies use
in taking pictures. If you look closely you will
see that the front is shaped like a button. The
tiny lens is in the center of that button. You
put that in a button hole and draw the bulb
up under your arm. Each press of your arm
takes a picture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you get it?&rdquo; he asked a second
time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh please!&rdquo; Florence was horribly confused.
She did not feel ready to tell the whole
story. &ldquo;Please. I did not know it was of any
consequence. Shows how good a lady cop I
am! But I&mdash;I got it under very unusual circumstances.
I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell you. I&rsquo;ll have to, but
not&mdash;not just now, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh that&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo; Danby&rsquo;s tone was
kindly. &ldquo;Would you mind letting me have it
for a time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not.&rdquo; Florence held it out to
him.</p>
<p>Just then the butler appeared. &ldquo;James,&rdquo; said
Danby, &ldquo;give this to Oliver and tell him to deliver
it at once to Mr. Mills at his photo shop.
If there chances to be a film inside, have him
instruct Mills to develop it with extraordinary
care, then to make enlargements of all the
good exposures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he said, turning to the ladies,
&ldquo;we may have our tea.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXII</span>
<br />THE SILVER SHIP</h2>
<p>Early on the following morning two
planes left the airport. One was small. It
resembled a dragon fly. In it rode Jeanne and
Madame Bihari. The other was a great bi-motored
cabin plane. It carried as its stewardess
our good friend Rosemary Sample. Her
passengers were as interesting a group as you
might hope to meet.</p>
<p>They were destined, these planes, for the
same little city, Happy Vale. Both Jeanne and
Rosemary were ignorant of this fact. So it is
in life, two congenial souls travel for years
along the same path, all unconscious of one another&rsquo;s
nearness.</p>
<p>Rosemary&rsquo;s interest in her passengers increased
as she became better acquainted with
them. They were, she discovered, from the
University&mdash;sociologists, teachers of ethics,
psychologists&mdash;all delightfully simple, kindly
people who laughed and joked about the long
strings of letters Ph.D., LL.D. and the like, attached
to their names.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>She was not long in discovering that a tall
thin man with long hair and thick glasses
named H. Bedford Biddle had chanced upon
what he spoke of as a &ldquo;rare find&rdquo; in the field
of sociology. They were all, it seemed, going
for a look at his &ldquo;find.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;find,&rdquo; she knew in advance, was Danby
Force&rsquo;s cotton mill and his little city of
Happy Vale. She was thrilled at the thought
of seeing him once more.</p>
<p>As she listened to these learned men discussing
the &ldquo;find&rdquo; she realized there was much she
could tell them about it. Not being asked,
however, she kept silent. She smiled from time
to time at their curiously learned remarks
about a thing that to her had seemed quite
simple and very beautiful, a group of common
people, working together to make their little
city the happiest, most contented in all the
world.</p>
<p>They landed on the outskirts of a beautiful
little city. A bus carried them to the factory.
There they were met by Danby Force who had
a very special message for the little stewardess.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted you to come.&rdquo; It was a rare smile
he gave her, something quite special that
warmed her heart. &ldquo;I felt you were interested
and would truly understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is&mdash;have you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; His voice was low. &ldquo;We have not
found her. We have no true notion of the
harm she may have done. We can only hope.&rdquo;
He was speaking, Rosemary knew, of the spy.</p>
<p>It was an hour later when, after a frugal
repast wonderfully prepared, they were ready
to enter the mill.</p>
<p>Rosemary had dropped modestly to the rear
of the group when of a sudden she noted some
stranger joining their party. With a quick eye
for faces she already knew all her party well.
&ldquo;He is not of our party, and yet,&rdquo; she told
herself, &ldquo;there is something familiar about
him. He gives me the shivers. I wonder why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little later she was thinking to herself,
&ldquo;Wonder if he has been invited to join us.
None of my affair&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo; But what? She did
not know.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>Invited or no, the youth did join this group.
He did go with them. To Rosemary his attitude
was disconcerting. A part of the time he
seemed quite indifferent, the rest of the time he
was like one on tip-toes. Drinking in every
word that was said, at the same time he went
through strange motions, fumbling first at his
vest, then at his pockets.</p>
<p>Their journey through the plant was half
over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Danby Force was saying, &ldquo;this is not
Utopia. We have made mistakes and been
criticized. Members of our group have complained
and claimed unfair treatment. Some
have moved away. This is human. But we are
trying to live up to our motto: &lsquo;Do something
for someone else.&rsquo; We&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>For the first time, with no apparent reason,
the mysterious stranger looked Rosemary
square in the eyes. His black eyes flashed a
dark challenge. Instantly she knew this was
no youth. This was the mysterious dark lady!
By the gleam of an eye she had made this discovery.
This woman had changed her complexion
and her disguise. She had returned for
more facts, perhaps for the secret formula.
And what was she, Rosemary Sample, to do
about it? Inside her a tumult was raging. Externally
she was calm. &ldquo;I must think,&rdquo; she
told herself, &ldquo;think calmly. And then I must
act.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">In the meantime Jeanne too had made a discovery.
Was it important? Who could tell?
An hour after Rosemary&rsquo;s party left the small
landing field at Happy Vale, Jeanne&rsquo;s dragon
fly came circling down to at last taxi to a position
close beside a small silver plane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That ship,&rdquo; Jeanne said to Madame, &ldquo;looks
familiar. And&mdash;&rdquo; she clapped her hands. &ldquo;I
know where I saw it before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her heart skipped a beat as, making a dash
for it, she peered within. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she breathed
out her disappointment. &ldquo;She is not there!&rdquo;
This was the luminous silver ship that one
night had hovered over her golden tree, the
very one she had followed so far next day.
She was sure of that. A young man sat at the
wheel. He seemed about to start the plane.</p>
<p>Throwing open the door, he said, &ldquo;Howdy,
sister. What can I do for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wh&mdash;where is she?&rdquo; Jeanne asked breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She?&rdquo; He appeared not to understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dark lady.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Which one?&rdquo; He laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m told there
are several in America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that Jeanne decided to give him up.
&ldquo;Only one more question,&rdquo; she thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you make it shine all over at
night?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are ten thousand holes in the fusilage
and the planes,&rdquo; he explained in a friendly
tone. &ldquo;Neon tubes made of a special kind of
glass run everywhere inside the plane. When
we light these tubes they shine out through all
the little holes. Simple, what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very simple,&rdquo; Jeanne agreed.</p>
<p>A moment later she saw him go bobbing
across the field to rise at last and soar away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; Jeanne told herself, &ldquo;he <i>did</i>
once have that dark lady, the spy, as a passenger.
Wonder if he has her still?&rdquo; She concluded
that plane would bear watching if it
ever returned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<h2 id="c23"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXIII</span>
<br />THE GYPSY&rsquo;S WARNING</h2>
<p>When Rosemary Sample discovered that
the person who had attached herself to
the learned party being conducted through the
textile mill was none other than the spy, she
found herself in a tight position. This visit of
the wise men, she realized from the look on
Danby Force&rsquo;s serious face, was an occasion of
no small importance. &ldquo;A group of University
professors do not charter a plane every day in
the week in order that they may be conducted
through a factory or mill,&rdquo; she assured herself.
&ldquo;If I cry &lsquo;WOLF!&rsquo;&mdash;if I let them know there is
an industrial spy in their midst, everything will
be thrown into confusion. The charm will have
been broken, the entire effect lost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep an eye on this spy,&rdquo; she thought,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see that nothing is taken from the mill.
When the tour is over I will see that she is
taken into account and made, at least, to explain
why she is here.&rdquo; That the matter would
go much farther than that, she did not doubt.
Would there be a struggle? She shuddered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>During the half hour that followed, though
no one would have guessed it, Rosemary heard
not a word that her good friend Danby Force
was saying to the learned professors.</p>
<p>And then, at the very end, Danby did something
that commanded her attention in spite
of herself. The guests were passing one at a
time through a narrow door. Danby was working
levers on a peculiar instrument.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you would like to know&mdash;&rdquo; there
was an amused look on his face. &ldquo;All of you
might like to know what I am doing. I am
spraying you with the light from an X-ray
lamp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In your case I am sure it is quite unnecessary.
But it is a precaution we take with all
those who pass through our mill. In these days
of keen industrial struggle there are spies
everywhere seeking to secure advantages
through trickery. They often carry tiny cameras
concealed upon their persons. Should
there be one such among you, the X-ray light
would entirely ruin his negatives. His picture-taking
would be without result.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>As he made this explanation Danby caught
and held the little stewardess&rsquo; interest for a
brief interval. Fatal interest. Ten seconds
later, when she gripped his arm to whisper,
&ldquo;Danby Force! There&mdash;there is your spy!&rdquo;
she found herself staring at empty space. The
spy had vanished.</p>
<p>Danby stared at her in amazement. &ldquo;What?
You don&rsquo;t mean&mdash;&rdquo; He was apparently unable
to finish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes! She was here. She was dressed
as a young man. But it was a woman. I saw
her fumbling at the back of her coat, as only
a woman would. And now&mdash;now she&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; He whispered low, that the professors
might not hear. &ldquo;Run outside. Perhaps
you can see her. If you do, ask any man
about the plant to seize her. He&rsquo;d do it at the
risk of his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no demand for such heroism. The
spy had vanished. Look where she might, call
others to her aid as she did, the little stewardess
could find no trace of her.</p>
<p>When, disappointed and downhearted, she
returned to the office of the plant, Danby
Force only smiled and said quietly, &ldquo;Forget it.
We will catch up with her yet. You&rsquo;ll see!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he added briskly, &ldquo;come with
me. We are to take this group of learned men
for a tour of our little city. Then, I regret to
say, we must part once more. You are to start
them back to Chicago in just one hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What Rosemary saw in that hour&rsquo;s ride
through shady streets and narrow, beautiful
lanes more than once caused her throat to
tighten with pure joy at the realization that
here at least was one community where happiness
and simple prosperity reigned. The
streets were clean, the narrow lawns well
cared for, the small homes painted, and the
people, for the most part, smiling.</p>
<p>Yet, even as her heart swelled with admiration
for those who could bring such a state of
affairs into being, her mind was filled with misgiving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem possible that one selfish person
could spoil all this,&rdquo; she said in a low tone
to Danby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet it <i>is</i> possible.&rdquo; His brow wrinkled.
&ldquo;Once the secrets of our new processes are in
the hands of unscrupulous persons, they will
be exploited. And that will bring ruin to us.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We have not tried to expand,&rdquo; he said a
moment later. &ldquo;Perhaps we should have done
so. But it has seemed to us that much of the
unhappiness of the world has been brought
about by the desire of honest but misguided
men to tear down factories and build bigger,
to cut costs, to sell cheaper in every market.
Our aim has been an honest living, and simple
contentment for all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Simple contentment for all,&rdquo; the girl whispered
to herself. &ldquo;What would that not mean
if it were realized by every person in this great
land of ours!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet, even as she thought this, an imaginary
colossal figure appeared to loom above her, the
figure of a dark-faced woman who never
smiled, and she seemed to be saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My bag! My traveling bag! It is gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet it was not gone,&rdquo; the girl told herself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a golden-haired French girl,&rdquo; Danby
Force was speaking again. &ldquo;She travels in
an airplane with a gypsy woman and a child.
Strange combination,&rdquo; he mused. Then, more
briskly, &ldquo;They have a secret of dyeing in purple
that would be of immense value to us. But
it belongs to hundreds of gypsies in France.
Dare we ask her to reveal that secret? Have
we a right to it? That, for the moment, is a
question. I am unable to answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Rosemary replied, &ldquo;I too know Petite
Jeanne. She is a dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little did either of them realize that at this
very moment Jeanne was close at hand, on
Happy Vale&rsquo;s landing field. Rosemary left that
very field an hour later without discovering
Jeanne&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>That afternoon, on wandering across the
grounds before the mill, Florence came face
to face with Hugo. He appeared quite worried
and ill at ease. His attempt to favor her with
one of his dazzling smiles was a failure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he know I took the picture?&rdquo; she
asked herself after he had passed on. &ldquo;Does
he know about the camera? And was it his
camera?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>As she closed her eyes and tried to picture to
herself the face of the spy she had so long
sought, she saw not Miriam Dvorac and her
dark sister, not Hans Schneider, not Ina Piccalo
and not the curious person who trimmed
the shrubs about the grounds. Instead, a very
different face appeared, a smiling face she had
seen many times before. Startled by this picture,
she exclaimed: &ldquo;No! No! It cannot be!&rdquo;
And yet the picture remained.</p>
<p>Yes, as Florence had guessed, Hugo was
troubled, so very much troubled that any person
with an eye for such things could have told
it quickly enough. And he was superstitious.
Oh, very much so! Selfish people who think
much of their own happiness and very little of
others are likely to be superstitious. So, when
one of his fellow-workers told him that something
very strange had happened&mdash;that two
gypsies, one very old and dark, and one young,
blonde and beautiful, had come flying in from
the air, he said at once: &ldquo;It is Fate. I shall
have my fortune told.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanne was not in sight when he arrived.
Madame Bihari, seated upon her bright rug
before the tent, was shuffling her witch cards.
Shuffling, dealing, then gathering them up to
shuffle and deal again, she did not so much as
look up as Hugo, magnificent in his bright
garments, approached. His roving eyes sought
in vain for the beautiful young gypsy. His
countenance fell.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But after all,&rdquo; he reasoned, &ldquo;I came to have
my fortune told. The older ones are best for
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old woman,&rdquo; he said rather rudely, &ldquo;tell
my fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madame did not look up. Her face darkened
as she cut and dealt the cards.</p>
<p>Hugo appeared to understand, for he said in
a quiet tone, &ldquo;I would like my fortune told.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madame looked up. Something like a dark
frown passed over her face. Madame had lived
long and in many lands. There were faces that
to her were like an open book in a bright light.
She read them with greatest ease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today,&rdquo; she said slowly, &ldquo;we have traveled
far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she shuffled and dealt once more.</p>
<p>Hugo grew impatient. He opened his lips to
utter harsh words, when Madame said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cross my palm with silver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carelessly, Hugo threw a silver half dollar
on the rug. The frown on Madame&rsquo;s face
deepened.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here are the cards,&rdquo; she said in an even
tone. &ldquo;You must sit down before me. You
must shuffle them well. You will cut them
with your left hand&mdash;this is very important,
then you will deal them six in a row, then eight
in a row for five rows, after that six in a row
once more. All must be face up with pictures
toward me. To deal wrongly is sure to bring
bad fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugo&rsquo;s hand trembled as he cut and dealt
the cards. Darkness had fallen. Only the glimmer
of a small fire lighted up the cards and
Madame&rsquo;s dark face. Despite his care, he
turned the picture of a snake toward himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Madame snatched at the card. &ldquo;You
have redoubled your misfortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here! Give me the cards! I&rsquo;ll deal them
again!&rdquo; Hugo exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is done is done.&rdquo; Madame&rsquo;s voice
seemed to come from the depths of a well.</p>
<p>And &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she muttered after one moment
of scrutinizing the cards. &ldquo;What an evil fortune
you have laid out before me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this Hugo appeared to exert all his will
to snatch away the cards, but seemed powerless
to move a muscle. So he sat there staring.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The mountain, the broken glass&mdash;&rdquo; Madame
was speaking now in a monotonous singsong.
&ldquo;The fox, the dog, the rapier, the lightning,
the lion, all clustered about you and all
telling of misfortune! My life has been long,
but never have I read such omens of evil!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And such a jolly life as you have lived!&rdquo;
She went on without looking up. &ldquo;Everything
has been yours&mdash;youth, love, friends, happiness&mdash;all
that you could ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now?&rdquo; The words stuck in Hugo&rsquo;s
throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now&mdash;&rdquo; Madame&rsquo;s voice rose. &ldquo;Now it
were better for you if you were not in your
native land. Discovery is at hand. Hate will
enter where admiration and love have lingered
long. The wealth you have hoped for will never
come. You shall wander far alone without
a friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Madame had ended this long utterance
of prophecy, she sat for one full moment
staring gloomily at the cards. Would she have
changed their reading if she could? Who can
say? How had she known so much? Had
someone told her? Certainly not. Had the
cards truly guided her? Again we must reply,
who knows? There is wisdom in every land
that to us, who think ourselves so very wise,
is hidden.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>When Madame looked up at last, Hugo was
gone. Darkness had closed about the place
where he had been. With a heavy high, Madame
gathered up her cards. Then, having
thrown fresh fuel on the fire, she called softly:
&ldquo;Jeanne! My Petite Jeanne!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanne peered with sleepy eyes from within
the tent. &ldquo;Jeanne,&rdquo; Madame said, &ldquo;tonight I
have told a fortune. Ah, such a terrible fortune!
Tomorrow, my Jeanne, tomorrow and
the day that is to follow, strange things will
happen, very strange indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not describe the person whose fortune
had been told, nor had Jeanne seen him.
She had been asleep in the tent. Perhaps this
was unfortunate. But you alone shall be the
judge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<h2 id="c24"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXIV</span>
<br />48&mdash;48</h2>
<p>It was rather late on the following afternoon
that Florence received a hurry-up call
from Danby Force. She went at once to his
office in the mill.</p>
<p>As she entered she found him in a fine state
of excitement. He had been pacing the floor
but, as she entered, he turned abruptly toward
his desk. Snatching up a handful of pictures,
he held them out to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at these!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence looked. &ldquo;They were taken inside
the mill,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By a spy!&rdquo; His eyes fairly shone. &ldquo;And
with the camera you gave me, the little one
that is worn in a button hole. Whose is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I truly do not know.&rdquo; Her head was in
a whirl. &ldquo;But I&mdash;per&mdash;perhaps I should tell
you. Yes, yes I must. Hugo stole a picture, a
very rare little painting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stole it?&rdquo; He stared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. He stole it. Can&rsquo;t be any doubt of it.
I saw it in his private room. I took it for the
rightful owner. This&mdash;this camera was behind
it. Was it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was his beyond a doubt.&rdquo; Danby was
staring harder than ever.</p>
<p>At that moment the girl thought she caught
some stealthy movement about the ivy outside
the window. She looked quickly. Did she
catch sight of a face? She could not be sure.
If so, it was gone on the instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hugo!&rdquo; Danby&rsquo;s voice rose. &ldquo;Hugo! He
is our spy! Who would believe it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pounded hard on an electric button.
Mark Sullivan, the day watchman, appeared at
the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mark,&rdquo; Danby said in a steady tone, &ldquo;go
find Hugo. Bring him here. If he refuses to
come, use force&mdash;but bring him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Hugo was not to be found. He was
gone. He had flown in the truest sense of the
word. Strangest of all, it was the little French
girl, Petite Jeanne, who aided in his escape.
This may not seem so strange when we recall
that Jeanne had never seen Hugo and that
Hugo surely had a way with the ladies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>It was late afternoon of that same day. Petite
Jeanne sat in the door of her dragon fly
airplane. The door faced the sun. She was
basking in its warmth. She loved the sun, did
this little French girl. She had once heard an
aged gypsy say the sun was the smiling face
of God. A rather fanciful remark this, yet it
had stayed in her mind. &ldquo;At least,&rdquo; she told
herself, &ldquo;God made the sun and everything He
created is good, so surely He means us to enjoy
the sunshine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All day long, without presuming to call upon
the busy Danby Force, or even upon Florence,
Jeanne had wandered through the town
and had come to love it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is wonderful!&rdquo; she had said to Madame
Bihari. &ldquo;And to think that any possible harm
might come to it! This indeed is too terrible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was thinking of all this when her eye
caught sight of a person approaching rapidly.
It was Hugo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are Petite Jeanne,&rdquo; he said. He appeared
to be in great haste.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a friend of Florence,&rdquo; he said, casting
his spell with a beaming smile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A friend of Florence is my friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; One might have detected in the man&rsquo;s
deep intake of breath a feeling of great relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you will help me!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But yes, if I may.&rdquo; Jeanne was on her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you would but take me a short distance
in your plane&mdash;it will not require an hour&mdash;you
will be back before dark.&rdquo; Hugo talked
rapidly as one in great haste.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could be easier? Will you come
aboard?&rdquo; Jeanne climbed to her place at the
wheel.</p>
<p>Ah, poor Jeanne! Had you but known!</p>
<p>A little thrill ran up the little flier&rsquo;s spine as
her plane took to the air. She felt restless, ill
at ease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah well,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;just one more incident
in a flying gypsy&rsquo;s life&mdash;nothing more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was more, much more than that, as she
was to learn.</p>
<p class="tb">Time passed. In Chicago it had been dark
for two hours. Rosemary Sample was seated
at her desk in her own private room. A radio
head-set had been clamped down over her ears
for two hours. She was reading a book. At
the same time she was listening. She had not
forgotten her promise to be on the air listening
every evening she was at her home port, listening
for that code number she had given so long
ago, but never forgotten.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>Of a sudden the book dropped from her
nerveless fingers. A message of startling clearness
had reached her ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;48&mdash;48! Petite Jeanne! One hundred miles
north of Happy Vale, an abandoned farm. You
will see my plane. Help! Come quick, or you
may be too late!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too late?&rdquo; Rosemary repeated, springing
to her feet.</p>
<p>A moment later she had Jerry, the mechanic,
on the wire:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That motor done?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;This
is Rosemary Sample.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just finished. But say!&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosemary hung up.</p>
<p>Another moment and she was talking to
Willie VanGeldt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willie,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;this is Rosemary Sample.
Be down at the flying field in a quarter
hour. I&rsquo;m going to take a ride in your plane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A ride? That&rsquo;s great! Say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>Once more Rosemary hung up.</p>
<p>When Willie appeared, prompt to the moment,
he found his plane oiled, fueled and
ready for flight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;You
said you&rsquo;d never fly in my plane. You&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hop in,&rdquo; Rosemary commanded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had
duplicated head-sets put in. We can talk on the
way. We&rsquo;ll be flying the best part of the
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Willie&rsquo;s mouth dropped, but, be it said to
his everlasting credit, he never faltered. Three
minutes later they were in the air flying an
air-lane in the dark.</p>
<p>Rosemary shuddered as she thought what
the outcome of this journey might be. Not
that night flying over a regular air route, such
as they were to follow for hundreds of miles,
is usually hazardous. It is not. The way is
&ldquo;fenced&rdquo; in by code signals broadcast by radio
stations along the way. If the pilot is on the
beaten path he hears a series of dot signals. If
he swings to the right, this becomes dot-dash,
and if to the left it becomes dash-dot, so he
never loses the way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Unless&mdash;&rdquo; the girl whispered to herself.
She had seen to it that Willie&rsquo;s motor was O.K.
She smiled grimly as she thought of the
month&rsquo;s pay it would cost her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if I had chartered one of our own
planes, it would have taken half a year to pay
up.&rdquo; That, with her mother back in Kansas
looking to her for part of her support, was not
to be considered. &ldquo;I just had to come!&rdquo; she
told herself. &ldquo;I promised. And that little
French girl would never call unless there was
some great need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to that motor!&rdquo; Willie chuckled in
her ear. &ldquo;Never heard it rattle along so
sweetly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Rosemary agreed, smiling down deep
in her soul, &ldquo;I guess you never did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For all that,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a real
sport, shooting away like this into the night
without asking a single question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willie!&rdquo; she exclaimed aloud, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting
dot-dashes! You&rsquo;re off the course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; she sighed ten seconds later.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s O.K.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they zoomed on into the night.</p>
<p class="tb">What had caused Jeanne to call for help?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>She had flown the hundred miles when, to
her surprise, she was ordered to make a landing
on a pasture of what appeared to be a small
farm.</p>
<p>This was a level country. She experienced
no trouble in landing and in taxiing her plane
up to a spot near the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Hugo commanded. &ldquo;There may be
some message to take back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was that about Hugo&rsquo;s look, the tone
of his voice that gave Jeanne a sudden impulse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as he&rsquo;s inside I&rsquo;ll take a run down
that pasture, then go into the air,&rdquo; she told
herself.</p>
<p>As if he had read Jeanne&rsquo;s thoughts, Hugo
turned and looked back. Then it came to
Jeanne as a sort of revelation, &ldquo;He must be
one of the spies! And I&mdash;I have been aiding
him to escape!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugo had disappeared through a door. Like
a flash Jeanne leaped for the shadows beneath
a window.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>There, chilling and thrilling, she listened to
strange voices. There were, she told herself,
a man and a woman. They spoke in a foreign
tongue. But Jeanne, who had lived long in
Europe, knew a little of many tongues. She
was able to understand enough to know that
they were discussing the advisability of flight
over the border.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But have you all the papers?&rdquo; a woman&rsquo;s
voice demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, all.&rdquo; It was Hugo who answered.
&ldquo;Pictures, diagrams, plans, everything. They
are there in the black bag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only I had that bag!&rdquo; thought Jeanne.</p>
<p>But now they had reached a decision. They
would come out. She must not seem to have
been listening.</p>
<p>To her surprise, as she sprang toward her
plane, she saw that it had grown quite dark.
The discussion had lasted longer than she had
thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here! Where are you?&rdquo; Hugo called. &ldquo;We
have decided to ask you to fly us to Canada.
We will pay you very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll have to see if I have enough gas,&rdquo;
Jeanne said in as even a tone as she could command.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>This was true. But that was not all. She
meant, at the risk of her life if need be, to get
off a message. Then it was that, after softly
closing her cabin door she had sent the message
that reached Rosemary Sample&rsquo;s ears and
sent her flying away into the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what am I to do next?&rdquo; Jeanne whispered
to herself, all but in despair. What indeed?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<h2 id="c25"><span class="small">Chapter XXV</span>
<br />LOST IN THE AIR OF NIGHT</h2>
<p>Petite Jeanne surely was in a tight
place. Hugo and the dark lady&mdash;for it was
she who had been with Hugo in the house&mdash;with
what they had described as all the material
needed to exploit the secret process of the
Happy Vale textile mill, were awaiting her.
To carry them across the border would be a
simple matter. She was close to a &ldquo;radio-fenced&rdquo;
air-lane. To follow this, even in the
night, was a simple matter.</p>
<p>But the little French girl did not propose to
follow it. To do this would almost certainly
lose for Danby Force his only chance to save
his happy little city from ruin.</p>
<p>No, Petite Jeanne could not do that. But
what could she do? Should she start her motor
and make a try at escape? To do this she realized
would be perilous. The spies might be
armed. She could not get away on the instant.
They might wreck her plane, or even worse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And they&rsquo;d still have their black bag,&rdquo; she
told herself.</p>
<p>She decided on flight, on foot, alone. Where
to? She did not know.</p>
<p>Opening the door of her cabin, without a
sound she slipped away into the night.</p>
<p>She had barely rounded the corner of a low
shed when she heard a door swing open, and
Hugo called:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here! Where are you? Is there gas
enough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Jeanne whispered beneath her breath.
&ldquo;But not for such an evil purpose!</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be after me with a flashlight,&rdquo; she
told herself, thrown into sudden panic.</p>
<p>The large red barn of the farm loomed before
her. Into its inviting darkness she crept.</p>
<p>At once a pleasing fragrance reached her
nostrils&mdash;Nature&rsquo;s own perfume, the smell of
new cut clover hay. Jeanne knew that glorious
perfume. More than once as a gypsy she
had slept within the shadow of a haystack.</p>
<p>Next instant, with breath coming short and
quick, she was climbing a narrow ladder leading
to the loft. At its top she tumbled into the
welcoming billows of sweet smelling hay.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>Creeping far back, she burrowed like a rat
and was soon quite lost from sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never find me here,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>She listened. The silence was complete.
Then she caught a low, rustling sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mice in this hay!&rdquo; She shuddered. She
hated mice; yet nothing could induce her to
give up this place of hiding.</p>
<p>From far below she heard Hugo call again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here! Where are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later, through the broad cracks
of the barn wall she caught a gleam of light,
then heard their sharp exclamations upon discovering
that she was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will they do?&rdquo; she asked herself.
&ldquo;Will they finally become angry and demolish
my plane? My so beautiful dragon fly!&rdquo; She
was ready to weep.</p>
<p>Would they attempt to fly the plane themselves
and wreck it? She could but wait and
see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never find me here,&rdquo; she repeated to herself
as she sank deep into the fresh cut clover.</p>
<p class="tb">In the meantime Rosemary Sample and Willie
VanGeldt were speeding to the rescue.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Strange business this for a steady going
stewardess of the air,&rdquo; Rosemary was saying
to herself. &ldquo;I suppose there are a million girls
who believe that being an airplane stewardess
is exciting. Nothing, I suppose, is less exciting.
But this&mdash;this is different, flying through
the night with an amateur pilot in a plane that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willie!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re on the dot-dash
again. Swing over. We&rsquo;ve got to keep
on the dotted line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Time passed. An hour sped into eternity,
and yet another hour. It was approaching
midnight. Rosemary switched on the dot-dot-dot
of the directive radio to tune in on her
home station and ask for a weather report.</p>
<p>The report filled her with fresh concern.
&ldquo;Willie,&rdquo; she said in a quiet voice that, after
all, was tense with emotion, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re headed
straight for a thunderstorm. Be in the midst
of it in less than an hour if we keep on this air-lane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if we don&rsquo;t keep on it,&rdquo; Willie groaned,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;re lost, lost in the air at night. I&rsquo;m for
zooming straight ahead. Storm may swing
some other way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>It did not swing some other way. Three
quarters of an hour later they were in the
midst of it. Lightning flashed from cloud to
cloud. The sky was black. Only the steady
dot-dot-dot of the directive radio gave them
hope.</p>
<p>And then, right in the midst of it, when the
wind was tearing at their wings, when their
struts were singing and the flash-flash of lightning
was all but continuous, disaster descended
upon them. Their radio went dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might have known!&rdquo; Rosemary groaned
within herself. &ldquo;Perfection, only perfection of
equipment and eternal vigilance such as a
great transport company exercises can save
one in the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll not say a word!&rdquo; She set her teeth
hard. &ldquo;Have to carry on.&rdquo; Snapping on a small
light attached to a cord, she set about the task
of inspecting the radio connections, a trying
task in such a moment of sky turmoil.</p>
<p class="tb">In the meantime the ones who had been left
marooned in that abandoned farmhouse by
Jeanne&rsquo;s sudden flight were discussing their
plight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<p>For a full half hour they had hunted the
missing little French girl. Giving this up at
last, they returned to the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is to be done?&rdquo; the woman asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is little to be lost by waiting,&rdquo; suggested
Hugo. He hated darkness and night.
&ldquo;She can&rsquo;t have gone far. It is pitch dark. A
storm is coming up out of the west. She has
no light. If she had, we should have seen it.
She will be frightened and return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why did she leave?&rdquo; the woman asked.
&ldquo;Did you give her cause for fear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugo shrugged. &ldquo;Who knows what a gypsy
will do? I should not have trusted her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll hardly do us harm before dawn,&rdquo; he
added. &ldquo;I have flown a plane a few thousand
miles. In daytime I would attempt a solo
flight, but at night, and a storm in sight? No,
it would not do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, having brewed themselves some
strong coffee and gulped it down, they settled
themselves as comfortably as might be to
await the coming dawn.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>And Jeanne? Strange as it may seem, hidden
away there in the hay, she had fallen fast
asleep. Had you been there to waken her and
ask her how she could sleep in such a place,
doubtless her answer would have been:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you have? I could not be
harmed more quickly asleep than when awake.
Besides, at heart I am a gypsy. Gypsies sleep
where and when they may.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">In the meantime Rosemary Sample and her
rich young pilot were battling the storm. Having
long since lost the beaten airway, they
were flying blind.</p>
<p>The storm was all about them. Now the
lightning appeared to leap across their plane
wings. Now, caught by a rushing gush of wind
and rain, they were all but hurled through
space; and now, met by a counter-current, like
a ship in a heavy sea they appeared to stand
quite still.</p>
<p>All this time, quite unconscious of the tumult,
Rosemary was working over the radio.
She tested a wire here, a tube there. She pried,
twisted and tapped, but all to no avail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<p>And then, with a suddenness that was startling,
they glided from out the storm into a
gloriously moonlit world. The earth lay silent
beneath them. The whole of it, groves of trees,
broad farms, sleeping villages, was bathed in
golden glory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only we knew where we were!&rdquo; Willie
sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But boy! Oh boy! What do you think of
my motor now? I didn&rsquo;t think it would go
through that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Rosemary replied drily.</p>
<p>Then of a sudden she fairly leaped to her
feet. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s working!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;The radio is
working! I&rsquo;m getting something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willie,&rdquo; she said a moment later, &ldquo;turn
sharply to the right and keep up that course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that for some time only the zoom of
the motor was heard. Then&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, Willie! I have it. Dot-dash, dot-dash!
Keep straight on. We&rsquo;ll be on the air-lane
in just no time at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they were.</p>
<p>Dawn found them wide-eyed and resolute,
circling the vicinity of that spot where they
believed Jeanne&rsquo;s message had originated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ought to find it,&rdquo; Willie grumbled. &ldquo;Getting
light enough. Just saw a farmer going
out to milk his cows. He&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; Rosemary stopped him. &ldquo;Hear
that! There&rsquo;s another airplane near here. Yes,
yes! There it is over there to the right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange.&rdquo; Willie&rsquo;s brow wrinkled.
&ldquo;They seem to be circling too. Wonder if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They might be looking for Jeanne&rsquo;s silver-winged
plane too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friend or foe?&rdquo; Willie&rsquo;s eyes were fixed
for a second on that other plane as if he would
read the answer there.</p>
<p>They began making wider circles. The
strange plane was lost to view when, with a
suddenness that was startling, the girl gripped
Willie&rsquo;s arm to exclaim:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! Right down there it is!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Jeanne had wakened from her sleep in that
strange, fragrant bed two hours before. For a
long time she had lain there wondering how
this affair was to end. She had all but dozed
off again when she was wakened by the familiar
and, to her at this time, startling sound
of an airplane motor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My motor!&rdquo; There was no mistaking that.
She knew the sound too well. At once she
went into a panic.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</div>
<p>&ldquo;My airplane!&rdquo; she all but wailed. &ldquo;My so
beautiful big dragon fly! Those terrible people
will try to fly it away, and they will wreck
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At once she was torn between two desires&mdash;the
wish to preserve her choicest treasure and
her desire to serve Danby Force and his wonderful
little city.</p>
<p>If she went to the spies now and offered to
fly them across the border, they would permit
her to do so, she was sure of that. But would
she do it?</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, oh no!&rdquo; she sobbed low. &ldquo;I must not!&rdquo;
She stopped her ears that she might not hear
her motor and be tempted too much.</p>
<p>That was how it happened that when Willie
and Rosemary came zooming down from the
sky to land upon that narrow pasture, she did
not hear them at all, and had no notion that
they had arrived.</p>
<p>Hugo had Jeanne&rsquo;s motor well warmed up
and was preparing to fly away when Willie&rsquo;s
airplane came to a standstill squarely in their
path.</p>
<p>As Rosemary leaped from the plane, the
woman came to meet her. She recognized her
on the instant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">[248]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; she said with no preliminary maneuvers,
&ldquo;is the little French gypsy&rsquo;s plane. Where
is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we knew, we would be glad to tell you,&rdquo;
the woman said coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; Rosemary insisted, &ldquo;there is
no need of covering things up. We know who
you are and why you are in America. You
need not attempt any violence. My companion
is fully prepared to meet you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She glanced at Willie who had one hand in
his pocket. She hoped he would keep it there.
One fears what one does not see. And she believed
these people were cowards. There might
be a pistol in Willie&rsquo;s pocket&mdash;just might.</p>
<p>Just how the matter would have ended had
not a second plane circled for a landing at that
moment, no one can say.</p>
<p>Rosemary was astonished and immensely relieved
to see Danby Force and two uniformed
officers alight from the plane. She was doubly
astonished thirty seconds later to see Petite
Jeanne, well festooned with clover, spring out
from the broad barn door and all but throw
herself into the arms of Danby Force as she
cried:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">[249]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is saved! My so beautiful big dragon fly
is saved! My heart and my happiness, they are
saved!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This spontaneous burst of joy brought a
smile even to the grim-faced dark lady.</p>
<p>Jeanne&rsquo;s heart and happiness were indeed
saved. So was the heart and happiness of many
another. When, confronted with the facts and
charged with spying out the secrets of the
Happy Vale mill, the strange woman admitted
it freely enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But remember this,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;I am no
thief. I had a camera. It was mine. I took
pictures. They also were mine. I made drawings
with my own hands. Surely that which
one creates is his own. I saw things. One cannot
be arrested for seeing. And more than
this,&rdquo; she added with a touch of sadness, &ldquo;I did
all this, not for myself, but for thousands in my
own land who should be as prosperous as your
people in Happy Vale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe this,&rdquo; said Danby Force, &ldquo;yet that
does not justify your action. To rob one community
that another may be prosperous gets us
nowhere.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">[250]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am willing, however&mdash;&rdquo; he spoke slowly.
&ldquo;I am willing to make matters as simple as
possible. If you are willing to surrender the
pictures and papers you have in your possession,
if you will submit to a search and will
leave our land empty-handed, we of Happy
Vale will forgive and forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This the dark lady could not refuse. Her papers
were surrendered and were taken over by
Danby Force.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for you!&rdquo; Danby Force turned to Hugo.
On his face was a look in which was strangely
mingled sorrow, pity and scorn. &ldquo;You are an
American citizen. This woman has been doing
what she could for her people&mdash;doing it in a
wrong way, but doing it all the same. You&mdash;&rdquo;
he paused. &ldquo;You have sold out your own countrymen
to her for gold. You were given the
friendship, love, admiration and loyalty of our
people. You sold it for a price. You attempted
to steal the labor of another&rsquo;s brain. For this
there is no legal penalty. But to know that
you have been a traitor, to know that thousands
who have admired you will think of you
as a traitor, to live all your life remembering
that you have been a traitor, that is punishment
enough. You may go.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">[251]</div>
<p>With bowed head, the once magnificent
Hugo disappeared from their sight. And at
that Petite Jeanne&rsquo;s heart was heavy with sorrow.
Why? Who could tell?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Willie VanGeldt to the little
stewardess when they were alone once
more, &ldquo;what do you think of my motor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Rosemary soberly, &ldquo;that if I
hadn&rsquo;t spent a month&rsquo;s pay having it put in
order, we would not be here at all. It would
never have carried us through the storm had
it not been for that. So&mdash;o! Chalk up one big
mark for the Flying Corntassel from Kansas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? You?&rdquo; Willie stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she smiled. &ldquo;I did that. But forget
it. Only take a solemn vow with yourself and
me that you will never, never go into the air
again unless a mechanic&rsquo;s seal of &lsquo;Perfect&rsquo; is
stamped upon your plane! The little French
girl was right&mdash;life <i>is</i> God&rsquo;s most beautiful
gift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said the boy soberly, &ldquo;if anyone
really cares.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God cares.&rdquo; Rosemary spoke soberly, too.
&ldquo;Your mother cares, and I care. That should
be enough.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">[252]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Willie huskily, &ldquo;it is enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Next morning there was a gypsy party in
Danby Force&rsquo;s garden. Over a brightly glowing
fire luscious steaks were broiling. The
aroma of coffee and all manner of good things
to eat filled the air. Jeanne was there and
Florence, Willie, Rosemary, Madame Bihari,
Danby Force and his mother&mdash;a very merry
party indeed. By the help of all, a cloud had
been driven away from the skies above Happy
Vale. Why should they not be merry?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow,&rdquo; Florence said to Danby Force
at the end of the glorious evening, &ldquo;I shall fly
away with my little gypsy friend, Petite
Jeanne. I shall not return. But wherever I am,
whatever I do, I shall not forget Happy Vale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor shall Happy Vale ever forget you,&rdquo;
Danby replied solemnly.</p>
<p>And what happened next to all these people
who have become your friends? Well, if you
watch for a book called <i>The Crystal Ball</i> and
read it you will hear more about them.</p>
